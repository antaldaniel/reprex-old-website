  &lt;div&gt;
    Reprex is a finalist for The Hague Innovators Award 2022, and the prize of the audience, in the startup category with our respectable competitors, Sibö, WECO, STHRIVE and ECOBLOQ.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition towards a sustainable and inclusive economy depends on collaboration. That is why we are bringing together startups, scale-ups, investors, policymakers, and other impact makers from around the world in The Hague for the 7th edition of ImpactFest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.impactcity.nl/en/service/the-hague-innovators-challenge/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Hague Innovators Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, the municipality of The Hague challenges startups, scale-ups, and students to present their innovative ideas for global issues, as described in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nominees receive a substantive program aimed at further development and the growth of the plan or organization. At the end of the substantive program, all nominees submit a definitive action plan and this is pitched to a professional jury. The jury chooses one winner per category.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our Listen Local project aims to develop tools that can be used by independent labels and self-releasing artists to make sure that their music finds relevant audiences in their scene, in their geographical environment and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    The purpose of the meetup is to provide an informal setting to get to know each other, or exchange ideas and get into action. RSV on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eventbrite.com/manage/events/411140571517/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eventbrite&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=&#34;https://keybase.io/team/reprexcommunity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Keybase&lt;/a&gt; or via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/#contact&#34;&gt;contact form&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working with leading EU and UK universities and industry associations to find out why sometimes Utrecht-based music is not recommended to people in Utrecht on streaming platforms? Or how we could build applications that bring the local music ecosystem into the attention of visitors, tourists?  Or how we could build games or educational applications that help local youth, pupils, students, educators, with artists in their town, and expand their music discovery to the province, their country, neighboring countries, instead of only recommending a few artists from New York, London, Rio de Janeiro or Seoul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of MusicAIRE and Horizon Europe, Europe’s premiere research and innovation grant, we are building open source tools to help to solve these problems, or allow other developers to build new applications and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reprex is a member of the Dutch AI Coalition&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlaic.com/en/sectors/culture/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Culture and Media Working Group&lt;/a&gt;. The Dutch AI Coalition wants to make sure that algorithms work for all. This informal event will take place after the annual gathering of the working group from 9.00-18.00, with working groups members optional visit the Culture AI Lab.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reprex presented its &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://ccsi.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cultural Creative Sectors Industries Data Observatory&lt;/a&gt; as platforms for developing and evaluating trustworthy AI in the cultural domains. We hope to find new partners within the NLAIC community to join our open, collaborative projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was particularly important for us to get away from the Hague, and meet organizations like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.den.nl/over-ons/english&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;DEN&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kb.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;KB&lt;/a&gt; to find out how our ambitious plans could connect to their excellent work. Reprex is a finalist in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/talk/impactcity-startup-support-xl/&#34;&gt;Hague Innovators Challenge 2022&lt;/a&gt;, and we would like to bring at least one global observatory, the planned European Music Observatory, into our beautiful and smart city. While knowledge graphs are virtual and live in the web 3.0, the Dutch AI Coalition and the country&amp;rsquo;s future competitiveness need to ensure that essential knowledge graphs will be managed by the ecosystem of Netherlands-based researchers, institutions, and startups. The ethical consciousness shown by the members of our Culture AI Lab shows that it is probably the best for future human generations globally, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Culture AI Lab presented a handful of very interesting, ethical and interesting projects. &lt;a href=&#34;https://pressingmatter.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Pressing Matter&lt;/a&gt; responds to growing concerns in the Netherlands and Europe about how to deal with the legacies of colonialism in museums and builds innovative tools for museums (and broader society) to address the question of ownership of objects collected in the colonial period. &lt;a href=&#34;https://picch-project.org/Emily-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dr Emily Hansell Clark&lt;/a&gt;, former editor of our Data&amp;amp;Lyrics blog, presented the Polyvocal Interpretation of Contested Colonial Heritage project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both projects are conceptually and technologically relevant to our Listen Local project. Our project aims to prevent the colonization or start the de-colonization of the local music ecosystem and make local artists of Utrecht, Vilnius, or Sarajevo visible and audible in their own cities&amp;rsquo; public spaces or on the smartphones of their town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most compelling use case of Listen Local project is finding out why music recommender systems do not recommend some music at all. Or why is it so hard to connect Utrecht-based artists with fans living or visiting Utrecht on the Spotify or YouTube platform? &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3514094.3539536&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The Responsible Recommenders in the Public Library Sector&lt;/a&gt; is looking for similar answers for librarians to avoid all recommendations to visitors pointing to U.S. authors and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our deep dive into legislative and regulatory issues of AI highlighted that the past decade unleashed global web-based tools that have the potential to undermine our democratic and cultural cohesion. Reassuringly, we have seen that our thinking about the dangers of AI on European culture and the technological solutions to combat them are very widely shared by NLAIC Culture and Media members. We hope that our partners&amp;rsquo;  policy work in the Digital Music Observatory and our forming new observatories will support policy design and decision-making that will protect the Netherlands and the EU from some of these threats.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://reprex.nl/talk/listen-local/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Antal will introduce &lt;code&gt;Listen Local Lithuania&lt;/code&gt;, a new offspring of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;’s trustworthy AI program, &lt;a href=&#34;http://listen-local.net/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt;, and show what artists, managers, labels, and cultural policymakers can do to ideas about balancing the post-Covid revenues with increased sales on global platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our experience in Slovakia (see: &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/listen_local_2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia &amp;amp; Abroad&lt;/a&gt;), and new data from Lithuania and Ukraine we show what data management problems make the Lithuanian music invisible for the AI algorithms of YouTube, Spotify and other platforms; how artists from Vilnius or Kaunas can find their new release on &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-24-forgetify_pop_october/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Forgetify&lt;/a&gt;, and app that plays songs that were never played. We show why music revenues decreased in the past years for independent and small country catalogues, and we give practical advice on increasing the value and visibility of the Lithuanian music repertoire. We show an open, data federation model to connect the Lithuanian national library the system of collective management, distributors, and small data of artists and labels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prepare-your-questions&#34;&gt;Prepare your questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want to know why your music is not recommended by streaming platforms?  Are you interested in finding new Lithuanian music that fits into your radio or festival programming but your are stuck? You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/#contact&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;send questions&lt;/a&gt; prior to the conference to the speaker, &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/daniel-antal/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Daniel Antal&lt;/a&gt;, and we&amp;rsquo;ll address your problem with examples in the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;opt-in&#34;&gt;Opt-in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can opt-in into our database before or during the conference, and we will give you tailored analysis about your data quality, and your opportunities to place your music to new audiences in Lithuania and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;venue&#34;&gt;Venue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk will be in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wnim.lt/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;what&amp;rsquo;s next in music&lt;/a&gt; conference  or follow them on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/WhatsNextInMusic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Participation is free but requires registration.  (We will post shortly more details on this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time set for the talk is &lt;code&gt;EEST Vilnius time&lt;/code&gt; (GMT+02.00).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;not-available&#34;&gt;Not available?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can meet the project&amp;rsquo;s manager and the speaker on 10 September in Kaunas, at the closing event of &lt;a href=&#34;https://wnim.lt/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;what&amp;rsquo;s next in music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Listen Local Lithuania&lt;/code&gt; is supported by the European Union&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://musicaire.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MusicAIRE&lt;/a&gt;, an EU-funded project that aims to provide tailored-made instruments for the sector and contribute to a green, digital, just, and resilient recovery of the music ecosystem. It is managed by MXF in collaboration with Music Export Ukraine and Reprex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/mxf-muzikos-eksporto-fondas/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MXF&lt;/a&gt; and the outcomes of the &lt;code&gt;Listen Local Lithuania&lt;/code&gt; will participate in the OpenMusE project, an international research and innovation project with prestigious universities, music industry stakeholders, collective management organizations, and innovative SMEs to design tools that promote the diversity of music on global platforms, increase the revenues and decrease the data costs of music organizations, provide cultural policymakers with the Open Policy Analysis framework the first time in Europe. This open collaboration project funded for 2023-2025 is open for small and large music organizations, collective management organizations, libraries, and cultural policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithuanian creators, including music creators, should earn as much as the European average. Their income should level up to German and Finnish levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithuanian people should find good Lithuanian music in Lithuania on Spotify, YouTube and the radio. Foreign labels must not increase their market share and colonize the local creative ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;joining-the-european-union&#34;&gt;Joining the European Union&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should creators earn less than other skilled occupations and knowledge workers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should artists get less paid than the average in Lithuania?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why should Lithuanians get paid less than the average European?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Is the algorithm cheating? ➡️ trustworthy AI policy, enabling courts, competition and consuerm protection agencies to protect the Lithuanian CCIs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the algorithm learning from bad data? ➡️  national heritage policy, consolidate Lithuanian CCI data as linked, open data, and synch it daily with the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we ask for 20% Lithuanian music in radio, television, YouTube or Spotify?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;lithuania-is-no-different&#34;&gt;Lithuania is no different&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are initiatives in the progress: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latga.lt/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LATGA&lt;/a&gt; already improved the rights management for one part of the composer&amp;rsquo;s rights management, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mic.lt/en/about-us/#3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MIC&lt;/a&gt; has more than 400 profiles in their database online, &lt;a href=&#34;https://musicassociation.lt/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LMVA&lt;/a&gt; already lobbied for quotas, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/kurybiskoseuroposbiuras/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Kūrybiškos Europos biuras&lt;/a&gt; has bright funding ideas, and the country has a respected national library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are facts and ideas: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ltkt.lt/admin/ckeditor/fileman/Uploads/SAMS/ATASKAITOS/LKT%20ataskaita%20muzika%20Pakarklyte.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Muzikos sritis - Ekspertinio vertinimo ataskaita&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&#34;http://kurklt.lt/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Rekomendacijos.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ArtTech – galimybės Lietuvos kultūros ir kūrybinių industrijų sektoriui.

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;still-a-lot-to-do&#34;&gt;Still a lot to do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Still much to do&lt;/code&gt;: revaluing music requires a cooperation of all rightsholders, making sure that the AI systems of streaming services work well requires linking (elements of) the existing databases, probably via the library, to &lt;code&gt;web of data&lt;/code&gt; to sync knowledge into the global global databases about Lithuania. Plenty of education needed how to revalue, claim money or defend the country from dark algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trustworthy Autonomous Recommender Systems on Music Streaming Platforms</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2022-02-28-tas/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 19:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2022-02-28-tas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently almost 60% of the global recording industry sales are made via streaming platforms. Given the enormity of choice on these platforms, and that music listening is a low-key, routine consumption choice, consumers are more and more relying on the recommendations of autonomous recommendation systems. Streaming platforms are two-sided markets, where recommendations are deployed to enhance the user experience on the consumer side, but they also decide the fate of the investments that composers, lyricists, producers, and performers made into the music. We are going to contribute to a research on how such systems may lead to potentially tilted competition field between the content providers, and more specifically, between major labels and independents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reprex maintains the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/publication/listen_local_2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; system for granular microdata about music use in small territories (i.e., on small country or sub-national level.) We will provide data/expertise in music streaming and recommendation systems and links to many relevant stakeholders with our considerable experience running experiments on music platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research team of the University of East Anglia (UEA) the University of Liverpool (UoL), The University of London (City), and King’s College (KCL), supported by the Competition Market Authority of the United Kingdom and Reprex won a prestigious research grant to understand how recommender systems on music streaming platforms can employ trustworthy AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers will explore the relationship between the autonomous recommendation systems and entry barriers via simulation. Working closely with Reprex, they will simulate sets of users, and iteratively generate recommendation lists, which the simulated users will react to by deciding how long to engage for and which recommendations to listen to. Through their engagement their user profiles will be updated based on what they listen to which will feed into future recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The empirical experiments of the project want to explore how autonomous recommendation systems are driving consumer choice in a real-life setting, and to establish causality between the recommendation systems and the barrier to entry. As part of the second work package, the researchers will conduct randomised trials by inviting participants to stream music through our own user interface. Reprex has extensive experience conducting similar experiments in the music domain (for various online, field experiments, and high-quality surveys.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the announcement of JUMP, the European Music Market Accelerator, after a careful screening of all applications received, the selection committee composed of all JUMP board members has selected the most promising ideas and projects to be developed together with renowned tutors for this 2021 fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nine months, the 20 fellows living in many European countries will develop their innovative projects, while receiving a comprehensive 360° training. In addition to specialised workshops by highly qualified experts, each fellow will receive one-on-one tutoring sessions from the most renowned music professionals coming from all over Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20 selected projects cover a great variety of urgent needs faced within the music sector.
They will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;help fostering social change with projects focusing on diversity in the industry, more fairness and
transparency as well as raising awareness on timely issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enhance technological development with projects using blockchain, immersive sound and VR and AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;build bridges between different key actors of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-24-music-level-playing-field/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 21:23:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-24-music-level-playing-field/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our article, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/music-streaming-is-it-a-level-playing-field/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?&lt;/a&gt; is published in the February 2021 issue of CPI Antitrust Chronicle, which is fully devoted to competition policy issues in the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic growth of music streaming over recent years is potentially very positive. Streaming provides consumers with low cost, easy access to a wide range of music, while it provides music creators with low cost, easy access to a potentially wide audience. But many creators are unhappy about the major streaming platforms. They consider that they act in an unfair way, create an unlevel playing field and threaten long-term creativity in the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our paper describes and assesses the basis for one element of these concerns, competition between recordings on streaming platforms. We argue that fair competition is restricted by the nature of the remuneration arrangements between creators and the streaming platforms, the role of playlists, and the strong negotiating power of the major labels. It concludes that urgent consideration should be given to a user-centric payment system, as well as greater transparency of the factors underpinning playlist creation and of negotiated agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the entire issue and the full text of our article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Competition Policy International&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-Music-Streaming-Is-It-a-Level-Playing-Field-By-Daniel-Antal-Amelia-Fletcher-14-Peter-L.-Ormosi.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Antal, co-founder of Reprex, was selected into 2021 Fellowship program of JUMP, the European Music Market Accelerator. Jump provides a framework for music professionals to develop innovative business models, encouraging the music sector to work on a transnational level.  The European Music Market Accelerator composed of MaMA Festival and Convention, UnConvention, MIL, Athens Music Week, Nouvelle Prague and Linecheck support him in the development of our two, interrelated projects over the next nine months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/project/music-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; is a demo version of the European Music Observatory based on open data, open source, automated research in open collaboration with music stakeholders. We hope that we can further develop our business model and find new users, and help the recovery of the festival and live music segment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reprex, our start-up, is based in the Netherlands and the United States that validated its early products in the &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/&#34;&gt;Yes!Delft AI+Blockchain Lab&lt;/a&gt; in the Hague. In 2021, we decided to join the Dutch AI Coalition &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlaic.com/en/about-nl-aic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NL AIC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NL AIC is a public-private partnership in which the government, the business sector, educational and research institutions, as well as civil society organisations collaborate to accelerate and connect AI developments and initiatives. The ambition is to position the Netherlands at the forefront of knowledge and application of AI for prosperity and well-being. We are continually doing so with due observance of both the Dutch and European standards and values. The NL AIC functions as the catalyst for AI applications in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are particularly looking forward to participating in the Culture working group of NLAIC, but we will also take a look at the Security, Peace and Justice and the Energy and Sustainability working groups.  Reprex is committed to use and further develop AI solutions that fulfil the requirements of trustworthy AI, a human-centric, ethical, and accountable use of artificial intelligence.  We are committed to develop our data platforms, or automated data observatories, and our Listen Local system in this manner. Furthermore, we are involved in various scientific collaborations that are researching ideas on future regulation of copyright and fair competition with respect to AI algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to applying reproducible in an open collaboration with our business, scientific, policy and civil society partners, and facilitate the use of open data and open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ensuring the Visibility and Accessibility of European Creative Content on the World Market: The Need for Copyright Data Improvement in the Light of New Technologies</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-13-european-visibility/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2021 18:10:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-13-european-visibility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of music sales in the world is driven by AI-algorithm powered robots that create personalized playlists, recommendations and help programming radio music streams or festival lineups. It is critically important that an artist’s work is documented, described in a way that the algorithm can work with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our research paper – soon to be published – made for the Listen Local Initiative we found that 15% of Dutch, Estonian, Hungarian, or Slovak artists had no chance to be recommended, and they usually end up on &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-11-17-recommendation-analysis/&#34;&gt;Forgetify&lt;/a&gt;, an app that lists never-played songs of Spotify. In another project with rights management organizations, we found that about half of the rightsholders are at risk of not getting all their royalties from the platforms because of poor documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how come that distributors give streaming platforms songs that are not properly documented?  What sort of information is missing for the European repertoire’s visibility?  Reprex is exploring this problem in a practical cooperation with SOZA, the Slovak Performing and Mechanical Rights Society, and in an academic cooperation that involves leading researchers in the field. A manuscript co-authored Martin Senftleben, director of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ivir.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Institute for Information Law&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam, and eminent researchers in copyright law and music economics, Reprex’s co-founder makes the case that Europe must invest public money to resolve this problem, because in the current scenario, the documentation costs of a song exceed the expected income from streaming platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the European Strategy for Data, the European Commission highlighted the EU’s ambition to acquire a leading role in the data economy. At the same time, the Commission conceded that the EU would have to increase its pools of quality data available for use and re-use. In the creative industries, this need for enhanced data quality and interoperability is particularly strong. Without data improvement, unprecedented opportunities for monetising the wide variety of EU creative and making this content available for new technologies, such as artificial intelligence training systems, will most probably be lost. The problem has a worldwide dimension. While the US have already taken steps to provide an integrated data space for music as of 1 January 2021, the EU is facing major obstacles not only in the field of music but also in other creative industry sectors. Weighing costs and benefits, there can be little doubt that new data improvement initiatives and sufficient investment in a better copyright data infrastructure should play a central role in EU copyright policy. A trade-off between data harmonisation and interoperability on the one hand, and transparency and accountability of content recommender systems on the other, could pave the way for successful new initiatives. &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3785272&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Download the manuscript from SSRN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-12-17-demo-slovak-music-database/&#34;&gt;Slovak Demo Music Database&lt;/a&gt; project is a best example for this. We started systematically collect publicly available information from Slovak artists (in our write-in process) and ask them to give GDPR-protected further data (in our opt-in process) to create a comprehensive database that can help recommendation engines as well as market-targeting or educational AI apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that one of the problems of current AI algorithms that they solely or almost only work with English language documentation, putting other, particularly small language repertoires at risk of being buried below well-documented music mainly arriving from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are looking for rightsholders and their organizations, artists,
researchers to work with us to find out how we can increase the visibility of European music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia &amp; Abroad</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/publication/listen_local_2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/publication/listen_local_2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Download the study &lt;a href=&#34;https://zenodo.org/record/6427556/files/Listen_Local_Feasibility_Study_2020_SK.pdf?download=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in Slovak&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://zenodo.org/record/6427514/files/Listen_Local_Feasibility_Study_2020_EN.pdf?download=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in English&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, realizing the low visibility and income-generating potential of Slovak music, the legislation introduced an amendment to the broadcasting act to regulate local content in radiostreams. The Slovak content promoting policy was well-intended but not based on any impact assessment, and it reached its goal only partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Slovak broadcasting quotas in comparison with other national quotas a very simple, and they are impossible to measure, which makes both compliance and enforcement very difficult. Radio editors do not get any help to find music that fits into the playlists and fulfil the quota obligations – in many cases, it is impossible for them to find out if a song actually meets the quota requirements. For the same reason, neither is enforcement possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another deficiency of the broadcasting quotas is that because of its fuzzy target, it is not clear whom it tries to help, and it has few friends. It is unclear how performers, composers or Slovak music producers can benefit from the system. Furthermore, it only helps a few genres, and it decreases the chances of other Slovak music in instrumental and non-Slovak language genres (for example, classical, jazz, rock) to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at last, radio is losing its importance in music discovery. New generation find the music during their music discovery age on YouTube and digital streaming platforms. A Slovak content promoting policy that does not work on digital streaming platforms will be obsolete when radio content providers will switch to digital streaming in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Feasibility Study follows the following logic:&lt;/strong&gt;
In the first chapter we introduce various music recommendation systems in the context of local content promotion polices, like local mandatory content quota regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second chapter, we consider the market-based or creative industry economy supporting policy goals, measurements, and potential support given to artists and producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then turn in the third chapter to content-based local regulations promoting the use of the Slovak language or Slovak music content, irrespective of the performers and producers nationality, residence or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce the idea of the &lt;strong&gt;Slovak Music Database&lt;/strong&gt;, a comprehensive, mainly opt-in, opt-out database that of Slovak artists and Slovak music that should be supported by the local content regulation and other policies. We also create a Demo Slovak Music Database to understand the problem and scope of the creation of the comprehensive version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project website contains the &lt;a href=&#34;https://listen-local.net/project/demo-sk-music-db/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Slovak Music Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://listen-local.net/project/demo-app/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Recommendation System&lt;/a&gt;. We explain here &lt;a href=&#34;https://listen-local.net/post/2020-11-23-alternative-recommendations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;why&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-questions&#34;&gt;Research questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are the total market shares of Slovak music relatively low both on the domestic and the foreign markets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we measure the market share of the Slovak music in the domestic and foreign markets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we measure the value gap between what some media platforms, most particularly the biggest YouTube, does not pay out to the Slovak stakeholders within Slovakia?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the interplay of the various definitions on market share and national quota targets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How ‘shadow-markets’ of home copying and unlicensed media platforms, such as YouTube impact market shares directly and national quotas indirectly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can modern data science, predictive microeconomics and statistics help increase the market share of Slovak music in Slovakia and abroad?&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Demo Slovak Music Database</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2020-12-17-demo-slovak-music-database/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Dec 2020 17:10:00 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are finalizing our first local recommendation system, Listen Local Slovakia, and the accompanying Demo Slovak Music Database. Our aim is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show how the Slovak repertoire is seen by media and streaming platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the possibilities to give greater visibility to the Slovak repertoire in radio and streaming platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the specific problems why certain artists and music is almost invisible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next year, we would like to create a modern, comprehensive national music database that serves music promotion in radio, streaming, live music within Slovakia and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To train our locally relevant, &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/post/2020-12-15-alternative-recommendations/&#34;&gt;alternative recommendation system&lt;/a&gt;, we filled the Demo Slovak Music Database from two sources. In the &lt;code&gt;opt-in&lt;/code&gt; process we asked artists to participate in Listen Local, and we selected those artists who opted in from Slovakia, or whose language is Slovak. In the &lt;code&gt;write-in&lt;/code&gt; process we collected publicly available data from other artists that our musicology team considered to be Slovak, mainly on the basis of their language use, residence, and other public biographical information. The following artists form the basis of our experiment. (&lt;em&gt;If you want to be excluded from the write-in list, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/#contact&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;write to us&lt;/a&gt;, or you want to be included, please, fill out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe seamless =&#34;&#34; name=&#34;iframe&#34; src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/htmlwidgets/sk_artist_table.html&#34; width=&#34;1000&#34; height=&#34;1050&#34; &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern recommendation systems usually rely on data provided by artists or their representatives, data on who and how is listening to their music, and what music is listened to by the audience of the artists, and certain musicological features of the music.  Usually they collect data from various data sources, but these data sources are mainly English language sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with these recommendation systems is that they do not help music discovery, and make starting new acts very difficult. Recommendation systems tend to help already established artists, and artists whose work is well described in the English language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our alternative recommendation system is a utility-based system that gives a user-defined priority to artists released in Slovakia, or artists identified as Slovak, or both. The system can be extended for lyrics language priorities, too.
Currently, our app is demonstration to provide a more comprehensive database-driven tool that can support various music discovery, recommendation or music export tools. Our Feasibility Study to build such tools and our Demo App is currently under consultation with Slovak stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/tag/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; is developing transparent algorithms and open source solutions to find new audiences for independent music. We want to correct the injustice and inherent bias of market leading big data algorithms. If you want&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;your music and audience&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;to be analysed in Listen Local, fill&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;in. We will include you in our demo application for local music recommendations and our analysis to be revealed in December.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendation systems utilize knowledge about music content and their audiences while also pursuing the objectives or needs of recommenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest recommendation systems just follow the charts: for example, they select from well-known current or perennial greatest hits. Such a system may work well for an amateur DJ in a home party or a small local radio that just wants to make sure that the music in its programme will be liked by many people. They reinforce existing trends and make already popular songs and their creators even more popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the recommendation engine is supported by big data and a machine learning system &amp;ndash; or increasingly, a combination of several machine learning algorithms &amp;ndash; the general &lt;em&gt;modus operandi&lt;/em&gt; is to exploit information about both content and users in order to achieve certain goals.&lt;/p&gt;

      How recommendation systems work?
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify’s recommendation system is a mix of content- and collaborative filtering that exploits information about users’ past behaviour (e.g. liked, skipped, and re-listened songs), the behaviour of similar users, as well as data collected from the users&amp;rsquo; social media and other online activities, or from blogs. Deezer uses a similar system that is boosted by the acquisition of Last.fm &amp;ndash; big data created from user comments are used to understand the mood of the songs, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

      Spotify makes 16 billion music recommendations each month in 2020.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube, which plays an even larger role in music discovery, uses a system comprised of two neural networks: one for candidate generation and one for ranking. The candidate generation deep neural network provides works on the basis of collaborative filtering, while the ranking system is based on content-based filtering and a form of utility ranking that takes into consideration the user&amp;rsquo;s languages, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes these systems common is that they maximize the algorithm creators&amp;rsquo; corporate key performance indicators. Spotify wants to be ‘your playlist to life’ and increase the amount of music played during work or sports in the background, during travelling, or active music listening –- i.e. maximizing the number of hours spent using it, and do not let empty timeslots for other music providers, such as radio stations. YouTube and Netflix have similar targets. They are in many ways like commercial radio targets, which want to maximize the time spent listening to the broadcast stream. Radios and YouTube, in particular, have similar goals because they are mainly financed through advertising. For Spotify or Netflix, their key financial motivation is to avoid users&amp;rsquo; cancelling their subscriptions or changing it to different providers, such as Amzon, Apple or Deezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-problem-with-black-box-recommendation-systems&#34;&gt;What is the problem with black box recommendation systems?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they also have in common is that they do not aim to give a fair chance to each uploaded song, serve equally every artist, or provide whatever equality of chances for English, Slovak or Farsi language content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tend to reinforce trends similarly to music charts, but with far bigger efficiency. As the Dutch comedian, author and journalist Arjen Lubach explains the YouTube algorithm, to keep their personal recommendations engaging all the day and all of the night, they create a comfortable universe for the user allows little distraction in. If the user wants to listen to global hit music, or stoner rock, it will never be distracted with anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;710&#34; height=&#34;410&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLoR2Spftwg?cc_load_policy=1&amp;origin=http://dataandlyrics.com&amp;cc_lang_pref=en&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zondag met Lubach on Dutch public broadcaster VPRO. Click settings sign to change the language of the captions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with such hyper-personalized media is that they leave no room for public activities.  Public broadcasters, which had a monopoly to television broadcasting in most European countries until the early 1990s, for example, were aiming to air a diversity of news, knowledge and access to local culture. Many countries on all continents have maintained &lt;code&gt;local content guidelines&lt;/code&gt; for broadcasting on public, commercial and community television and radio channels, for example, local music and films, and reliable news as a public service. Personalized media-, social media- and streaming platforms do not have such obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black box recommendation systems usually maximize a corporate key performance indicator, and they are not subject to usual public new service or local content regulations that traditional broadcast media is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal and the steps that the algorithm is pursuing is not know to content creators, and they do not know when will the algorithm work for their benefit or against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transparent-and-regulated-ai&#34;&gt;Transparent and regulated AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our view, utility-based recommendation system can provide a bridge between current, corporate-owned systems that maximize a media or streaming platforms&amp;rsquo; business indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public new service requirements or local content requirements (&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;national quotas&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;) set for commercial broadcasting are similar to utility or knowledge-based recommendation systems. A utility-based recommendation system, for example, would prefer from two candidates for a playlist the one that has a Slovak composer, or a performer from Wales, or which has Farsi lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Demo App creates recommendations on the basis of a pre-existing radio or personal streaming playlist that, by choice, contains a pre-defined ratio of music produced in Slovakia, or performed by Slovak artists. We will soon add Dutch and Hungarian choices to this demo, but naturally, we could add any city&amp;rsquo;s, regions&amp;rsquo;, province&amp;rsquo;s our countries preferences into the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Demo App and accompanying Feasibility Study in Slovakia shows how can a regulator create better broadcasting regulations, learning from the experience with AI-driven streaming platforms, and how can it apply the goals of local content requirements (such as a certain visibility for Slovak or a city-based music) and public service requirements (for example, spreading reliable information or stopping &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-30-racist-algorithm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hateful music&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;access-for-all&#34;&gt;Access for all&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not believe that the current heated discussion on the re-regulation of AI and music streaming will solve all the problems of independent artists, bands from ethnic or racial minorities, or otherwise vulnerable producers. New regulation can limit the unintended collateral damage of big data algorithms deployed by big corporations, but they will not bring down the benefits of AI to these creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the example of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/03/spotify-artists-promote-music-exchange-cut-royalty-rates-payola-algorithm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; new initiative that let&amp;rsquo;s artists, labels and publishers to promote their music in exchange for &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-11-02/amplifying-artist-input-in-your-personalized-recommendations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a cut in royalty rates&lt;/a&gt;. While felt by many artists injust and even corrupt, it is an answer to the growing need to influence how the recommendation algorithms are promoting certain music at the expense of tens of millions of sound recordings that are not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that algorithms create value for the users, and if artists are not happy to pay for corporations to influence black box algoritms, thatn they must collaborate and share data, and build large enough data pools so that they can deploy white, transparent algorithms that work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Feasibility Study shows why it is important that creators have a &lt;code&gt;control over what data describes their music&lt;/code&gt;, their biographies and other information online, because corporate streaming platforms use this information for their algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should that with relatively little effort creators can &lt;code&gt;pool enough information&lt;/code&gt; to create alternative recommendation systems that follow a more agreeable goal, that is sensitive to local content requirements and more access to new artists, women or black performers, or which suppress hateful lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of an &lt;code&gt;open algorithm&lt;/code&gt; and pooled data is that artists can actively look for audiences in various age groups or in cities that are accessible for them on a performing tour after the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we want to show that regulating black box, private algorithms and data monopolies is only a first step to damage control. Deploying white, transparent algorithms and building collaborative or open data pools can only guarantee fairness in the digital platforms, in recommendations, and generally in the use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/tag/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; is developing transparent algorithms and open source solutions to find new audiences for independent music. We want to correct the injustice and inherent bias of market leading big data algorithms. If you want&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;your music and audience&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;to be analysed in Listen Local, fill&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;in. We will include you in our demo application for local music recommendations and our analysis to be revealed in December.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Big data creates injustice.”&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; Cathy O&amp;rsquo;Neil, author of &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/review-weapons-of-math-destruction/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Weapons of Math Destruction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Listen Local&lt;/code&gt; is a trustworthy, ethical AI-powered system that aims to help great artists in small organizations and small countries using big data. We want to make sure that audiences are not only recommended global superhits, but locally relevant music, too. At present, corporate algorithms fail to connect listeners in small countries with music from the local scene - with artists whom the listener can easily see perform live in local venues, who sing in the listener’s language and who connect with the listener’s feelings and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the artist’s perspective, we want to understand why certain demographics of artists  only get partly paid, or not paid at all. We want to understand why some artists are never recommended by corporate AI algorithms. Every good music should be able to find its audience on streaming platforms; and, moreover,the global streaming platforms must give equal chances and fair remuneration to all musicians regardless of language, ethnicity, gender, race, or any other such factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music streaming services seemingly make the entire world repertoire available to any audience – which requires an entirely new approach to music education and music discovery. Most people discover music and learn to like a certain style or genre in their teenage years. If the AI algorithms that make personalized playlists and recommendations do not include locally relevant music, young people will not be exposed to local discoveries in their taste formation processes. This influences the genres and styles of music that people are open to encountering at later life phases and in later social worlds, including the exposure that adults pass on to their children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listen Local wants to prevent global hits from colonizing local musical ecosystems and taking attention, visibility and listening time from local acts. Music is a social activity, and young people should have the opportunity to discover artists whom they can see performing live with their friends, with whom they can learn to play on the same stage, or behind the same turntable. Our goal is to connect young people as well as adults to  music from  their local communities, and to help artists from small countries gain fair access to audiences and opportunities in their communities and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-we-do&#34;&gt;What do we do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are building a recommendation system that allows the user – a radio DJ or music editor, an educator, or a music lover –- to control the recommendation algorithm: for example, to set language preferences or to find music in his or her town or country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are conducting statistical tests that measure biases in the way artists with different ethnic, national, country of origin, race, scene, genre, age or gender background are promoted and paid, or other biases of algorithms when they recommend music or sell it, to analyze how global hits colonize local music ecosystems and to determine how to prevent this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this, we are gaining understanding of why certain artists are never recommended, or never get paid.
We are localizing AI. Because music for most artists is a local business, we are building tools that help artists connect to local audiences, target tour destinations that are within reach, and optimize domestic and foreign marketing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are involved in various research and development activities. We are building prototype applications with our partners, and we are conducting impact analyses to detect AI and big data problems. We are collaborating with eminent competition law and copyright law practitioners to understand how independent artists and small labels, publishers, and small country collective management organizations can be protected from the adverse effects of big data and AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-we-do-it&#34;&gt;Why do we do it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently more than half of global music sales is automated through AI algorithms.  YouTube, Spotify, Apple Music and other music and media streaming platforms use AI that compares the audience member’s preferences, biographical information about the creators and performers of the music, and the content and aesthetic qualities of the music to personalize recommendations from more than a hundred million recordings and videos. If the AI algorithm is biased or the supporting data and metadata is incomplete or faulty, some artists and performers will never connect  with new audiences, nor get paid. Further compounding this problem, bookings for festivals and clubs - the primary income source for most musicians and their technical and managerial support teams - are increasingly conducted through automated pre-selection by algorithms that monitor the recordings, sales, and fan bases of artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The severity of this problem is demonstrated by our pilot project, based on the rich, emerging local music market of Slovakia. Through our strong relationships with music stakeholders, we gained access to vast amounts of confidential data and insider expertise. Based on this pilot project, we estimate that 15% of small country artists are at risk of no exposure to a streaming audience, 50% are at risk of not getting properly paid, and up to 70% of the value of all payments are at risk of being delayed or lost. The numbers confirm it:  this system is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-we-do-it&#34;&gt;How do we do it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reprex is an international start-up that utilizes open data, open-source software and the scientific method of open collaboration to create meaningful AI and data service products. Reprex is a member of the &lt;a href=&#34;post/2021-02-16-nlaic/&#34;&gt;Dutch AI Coalition&lt;/a&gt; and the European AI Alliance, which are public-private partnerships to promote human-centric, accountable, trustworthy AI. Open data means that we utilize taxpayer funded public sector data and open scientific data on the basis of the Open Data Directive of the European Union. Open data is free, but requires significant investment to be repurposed for different uses (in other words, to process government-sourced data for business or scientific research purposes, or scientific data for public or business purposes.)  Reprex is investing in open-source statistical software that helps the creative industries harness the power of data as an open,  public resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code&gt;Listen Local&lt;/code&gt; project is aiming to create better radio playlisting, personal playlisting and concert promotion in a local context: within Slovakia or at a more specific level, Flanders or even the city of Utrecht or Budapest. We aim to place our partner’s music in local radio lists, personal playlists, and grow their fan base during the COVID-19 pandemic so that in 2021 they can eventually meet in the venues again, and carry out longer, more successful tours than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; grew out of a large, collaborative project of collective management societies, grant managers, music distributors, venues, and other music stakeholders who joined forces to collect more royalties from 2014 onwards starting with three, and eventually encompassing more than a dozen countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-do-this-together&#34;&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Do This Together!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-19-listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local: Open Collaboration Experiment &amp;amp; Feasibility Study&lt;/a&gt; - how you can participate in the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participation for artists and music venues is &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; in the experiment. We are looking for a viable business model that keeps this tool a good value for money for anybody in the independent music scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are asking labels, publishers, talent managers to contribute to our experimental budget on a crowdsourcing basis.  We ask for a nominal contribution from as little as 10-1000 euros on a voluntary basis.  In return. We hope to develop a tool that can make the work of independent labels and publishers easier. Any extra funding will be spent on the project at cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
