&lt;p&gt;According to the announcement of JUMP, the European Music Market Accelerator, after a careful screening of all applications received, the selection committee composed of all JUMP board members has selected the most promising ideas and projects to be developed together with renowned tutors for this 2021 fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nine months, the 20 fellows living in many European countries will develop their innovative projects, while receiving a comprehensive 360° training. In addition to specialised workshops by highly qualified experts, each fellow will receive one-on-one tutoring sessions from the most renowned music professionals coming from all over Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20 selected projects cover a great variety of urgent needs faced within the music sector.
They will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;help fostering social change with projects focusing on diversity in the industry, more fairness and
transparency as well as raising awareness on timely issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enhance technological development with projects using blockchain, immersive sound and VR and AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;build bridges between different key actors of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Open Data Day Interview: Mapping Data with Milos Popovic</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-03-03-ood_interview_maps/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 22:23:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-03-03-ood_interview_maps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Milos Popovic is a researcher, a data scientist, Marie Curie postdoc &amp;amp; Top 10 dataviz &amp;amp; R contributor on Twitter according to NodeXL. He took part in policy debates about terrorism and military intervention and appeared on a number of TV channels including N1 (the CNN affiliate in the Western Balkans), Serbian National Television and Al-Jazeera Balkans. My research interests are at the intersection of civil war dynamics and postwar politics in the Balkans. He is going to join the Data &amp;amp; Lyrics team on International Open Data Day to help us put harmonized environmental degradation perception and environmental sensory data on maps. We asked him four questions about his passion, mapping data. Please join us 6 March 2021 9.30 EST / 15.30 CET for an informal digital coffee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a researcher, why are you so much drawn into maps? Is this connected to your interest in territorial conflicts, or you have some other inspiration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a great question that really makes me pause and look back at the past 5 years. My mapping story started out of curiosity: I found interesting data on the post-WWII violence in Serbia and thought how cool it would be to make a map in R. I quickly made an unimpressive choropleth map and noticed some unexpected patterns. Then I realized just how much unused violence and census data sits out there while we have no clue about geographic patterns. So, it began. I started off with map-making but my curiosity took me to the world of georeferencing and geospatial analysis. In the process, I created over 300 maps hosted on my website as well as dozens of shapefiles from the scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think that my interest is linked to growing up in a war-torn country. But, as my map-making evolved, I discovered that my passion is to use maps as a way to democratize the data: to take the scores of unused, and often buried datasets, place them on the map and share the dataviz with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you show us an example of the best use of mapped data, and the best map that you have personally created? What is their distinctive value?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m immensely proud of my work that required making the shapefiles from the scratch. For instance, my shapefile of over 1500 Kosovo cadastral settlements came into being after I turned dozens of high-resolution raster files into a shapefile fully compatible with Open Street Maps. After months of hard work, I managed to merge the shapefile with the 2011 Kosovo census and present several laser-focused demographic maps to my audience. Same goes for the settlement shapefile of &lt;em&gt;Republika Srpska&lt;/em&gt; [the Serb-speaking entity of Bosnia-Herzegovina — the editor], which I made out of a pdf file and merged with the 2013 census data. Whereas most existing maps take a bird’s eye view, my work offers a more fine-grained view of the local dynamics to stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another similar undertaking was my transformation of the pre-WWII German military map of Yugoslavia into a unique shapefile of a few hundred Yugoslav municipalities. I combined this shapefile with the 1931 census data, 80 years after it was first published (better late than never!). It took me almost a year to complete this tremendous project but I enjoyed every bit of it. I have teamed up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://aleksandarpopovic.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my brother&lt;/a&gt; who is a web developer and we even made &lt;a href=&#34;https://milosp.info/maps/interactive/census1931/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;an interactive map of Yugoslavia based on the 1931 census&lt;/a&gt;.[&lt;em&gt;The screenshot of this interactive map is the top image in the post &amp;ndash; the editor&lt;/em&gt;] We hope this project would serve not only scholars but also history enthusiasts to better understand a history of the country that is no more.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think about collaboration based on open data and open-source software that processes such data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fantastic opportunity for small teams to bypass traditional gatekeepers such as state institutions or big companies and use open source apps for the benefit of their local communities. For example, the access to Open Street Map allows small teams to map pressing communal issues as crime, deceases, or environmental degradation and come up with innovative solutions. In my work, too, I used OSM has helped me create several fine-grained maps that shed more light on local problems in Serbia such as pollution, car accidents or violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are hoping to bring together environmental, sensory data and public attitude data on environmental issues? How can mapping help? What do you expect from this project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than ever, we are compelled to figure out how maladies spreads locally. Without mapping the hotspots, our understanding of the consequences of, for example, viral transmission or pollution is shrouded with a lot of uncertainty. We might have no clue how environmental issues shape public attitudes in localities until we use the mapping to turn on the light. Mapping would help this project pin down geographic clusters that require immediate attention from the private and public stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/talk/reprex-open-data-day-2021/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;join us&lt;/a&gt; for a digital coffee, tea or beer on International Open Data Day - we will put never seen data on maps, and discuss how to build successful open collaborations, with little, independent contributions to build large data observatories. Make sure you check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://milosp.info/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Milos&amp;rsquo; amazing website&lt;/a&gt;, too!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-24-music-level-playing-field/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 21:23:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-24-music-level-playing-field/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our article, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/music-streaming-is-it-a-level-playing-field/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?&lt;/a&gt; is published in the February 2021 issue of CPI Antitrust Chronicle, which is fully devoted to competition policy issues in the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic growth of music streaming over recent years is potentially very positive. Streaming provides consumers with low cost, easy access to a wide range of music, while it provides music creators with low cost, easy access to a potentially wide audience. But many creators are unhappy about the major streaming platforms. They consider that they act in an unfair way, create an unlevel playing field and threaten long-term creativity in the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our paper describes and assesses the basis for one element of these concerns, competition between recordings on streaming platforms. We argue that fair competition is restricted by the nature of the remuneration arrangements between creators and the streaming platforms, the role of playlists, and the strong negotiating power of the major labels. It concludes that urgent consideration should be given to a user-centric payment system, as well as greater transparency of the factors underpinning playlist creation and of negotiated agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the entire issue and the full text of our article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Competition Policy International&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-Music-Streaming-Is-It-a-Level-Playing-Field-By-Daniel-Antal-Amelia-Fletcher-14-Peter-L.-Ormosi.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Antal, co-founder of Reprex, was selected into 2021 Fellowship program of JUMP, the European Music Market Accelerator. Jump provides a framework for music professionals to develop innovative business models, encouraging the music sector to work on a transnational level.  The European Music Market Accelerator composed of MaMA Festival and Convention, UnConvention, MIL, Athens Music Week, Nouvelle Prague and Linecheck support him in the development of our two, interrelated projects over the next nine months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/project/music-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; is a demo version of the European Music Observatory based on open data, open source, automated research in open collaboration with music stakeholders. We hope that we can further develop our business model and find new users, and help the recovery of the festival and live music segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; is our AI system that validated third party music AI, such as Spotify&amp;rsquo;s or YouTube&amp;rsquo;s recommendation systems, and provides trustworthy, accountable, transparent alternatives for the European music industry. We hope to expand our pilot project from Slovakia to several European countries in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Ensuring the Visibility and Accessibility of European Creative Content on the World Market: The Need for Copyright Data Improvement in the Light of New Technologies</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-13-european-visibility/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2021 18:10:00 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of music sales in the world is driven by AI-algorithm powered robots that create personalized playlists, recommendations and help programming radio music streams or festival lineups. It is critically important that an artist’s work is documented, described in a way that the algorithm can work with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our research paper – soon to be published – made for the Listen Local Initiative we found that 15% of Dutch, Estonian, Hungarian, or Slovak artists had no chance to be recommended, and they usually end up on &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-11-17-recommendation-analysis/&#34;&gt;Forgetify&lt;/a&gt;, an app that lists never-played songs of Spotify. In another project with rights management organizations, we found that about half of the rightsholders are at risk of not getting all their royalties from the platforms because of poor documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how come that distributors give streaming platforms songs that are not properly documented?  What sort of information is missing for the European repertoire’s visibility?  Reprex is exploring this problem in a practical cooperation with SOZA, the Slovak Performing and Mechanical Rights Society, and in an academic cooperation that involves leading researchers in the field. A manuscript co-authored Martin Senftleben, director of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ivir.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Institute for Information Law&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam, and eminent researchers in copyright law and music economics, Reprex’s co-founder makes the case that Europe must invest public money to resolve this problem, because in the current scenario, the documentation costs of a song exceed the expected income from streaming platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the European Strategy for Data, the European Commission highlighted the EU’s ambition to acquire a leading role in the data economy. At the same time, the Commission conceded that the EU would have to increase its pools of quality data available for use and re-use. In the creative industries, this need for enhanced data quality and interoperability is particularly strong. Without data improvement, unprecedented opportunities for monetising the wide variety of EU creative and making this content available for new technologies, such as artificial intelligence training systems, will most probably be lost. The problem has a worldwide dimension. While the US have already taken steps to provide an integrated data space for music as of 1 January 2021, the EU is facing major obstacles not only in the field of music but also in other creative industry sectors. Weighing costs and benefits, there can be little doubt that new data improvement initiatives and sufficient investment in a better copyright data infrastructure should play a central role in EU copyright policy. A trade-off between data harmonisation and interoperability on the one hand, and transparency and accountability of content recommender systems on the other, could pave the way for successful new initiatives. &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3785272&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Download the manuscript from SSRN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-12-17-demo-slovak-music-database/&#34;&gt;Slovak Demo Music Database&lt;/a&gt; project is a best example for this. We started systematically collect publicly available information from Slovak artists (in our write-in process) and ask them to give GDPR-protected further data (in our opt-in process) to create a comprehensive database that can help recommendation engines as well as market-targeting or educational AI apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that one of the problems of current AI algorithms that they solely or almost only work with English language documentation, putting other, particularly small language repertoires at risk of being buried below well-documented music mainly arriving from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are looking for rightsholders and their organizations, artists,
researchers to work with us to find out how we can increase the visibility of European music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reproducible research in practice: empirical study on the structural conditions of book piracy in global and European academia</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2020-12-04-pirate-libraries/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 05 Dec 2020 08:10:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2020-12-04-pirate-libraries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt; is the fourth most influential multidisciplinary journal after Nature, and Science, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?category=1000&amp;amp;area=1000&amp;amp;order=h&amp;amp;ord=desc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;H index&lt;/a&gt;.) On December 3, 2020 it published &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242509&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; co-authored by Dr. Balazs Bodo, associate professor at the Institute for Information Law (IViR), Daniel Antal (Reprex, Demo Music Observatory), a data scientist interested in reproducible research, as an independent researcher, and Zoltan Puha, a Data Science PhD at Tilburg University, JADS. PLOS (Public Library of Science) is a nonprofit Open Access publisher, empowering researchers to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article utilizes the our reproducible datasets created with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://regions.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt; package, and builds on many years of expertise in empirical research on the field of music and audiovisual piracy, home copying and private copying compensation (see for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/private_copying_croatia_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Private Copying in Croatia&lt;/a&gt;.)  Our aim is to provide reliable, high quality indicators for the creative industries not only on national, but provincial, state, regional and metropolitan area level, too, because these levels are often more relevant for creators, performers and policy-makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of the paper is Library Genesis (LG), the biggest piratical scholarly library on the internet, which provides copyright infringing access to more than 2.5 million scientific monographs, edited volumes, and textbooks. The paper uses advanced statistical methods to explain why researchers around the globe use copyright infringing knowledge resources. The analysis is based on a huge usage dataset from LG, as well as data from the World Bank, Eurostat, and Eurobarometer, to identify the role of macroeconomic factors, such as R&amp;amp;D and higher education spending, GDP, researcher density in scholarly copyright infringing activities.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      We created a global and a far more detailed European model for pirate book downloads.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main finding of the paper is that open access, even if it is radical, is not a panacea. The hypothesis of the research was that researchers in low-income regions use piratical open knowledge resources relatively more to compensate for the limitations of their legal access infrastructures. The authors found evidence to the contrary. Researchers in high income countries and European regions with access to high quality knowledge infrastructures, and high levels of funding use radical open access resources more intensively than researchers in lower income countries and regions, with less resourceful libraries. This means that while open knowledge is an important resource to close the knowledge gap between centrum and periphery, equality in access does not translate into equality in use. Structural knowledge inequalities are both present and are being reproduced in the context of open access resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is unique not just because of the data it is based on. It also sets new standards in interdisciplinary legal research by publishing the paper, the data and the software code in the same time in open access repositories, following reproducible research best practices &amp;mdash; the practices that we want to promote in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and further data observatories to serve business, evidence-based policy and scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feasibility Study For The Establishment Of A European Music Observatory &amp; The Demo Observatory</title>

      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2020-11-16-european-music-observatory-feasibility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/a756542a-249d-11eb-9d7e-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-171307257&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; was published on 13 November.  Our private observatory, CEEMID was consulted in the creation of the Feasibility Study, and some of our recommendations found way into the consultant’s document. We created a Demo Music Observatory to provide a practical guidance on the decisions facing the European stakeholders, and to answer the questions that were left open in the Feasibility Study &amp;mdash; particularly on  &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/#data-gaps&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data integration&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/#organization&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;institutional model&lt;/a&gt;, where a wrong choice can lead to very long delivery time, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/#quality&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;quality control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;#budget&#34;&gt;budgeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been developing our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in the world&amp;rsquo;s 2nd ranked university-backed incubator program, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-15-music-observatory-launch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;15 September 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Our aim is to show a better organizational model, examples of &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-11-creating-automated-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;research automation&lt;/a&gt; and other data integration innovation that can reduce the budgetary needs of the European Music Observatory by 80-90% and provide far more timely, accurate, and relevant service than most data observatories in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEEMID has been creating a similar data observatory to the foreseen European Data Observatory, solely based on the contribution of about 60 European stakeholders.  As the &lt;em&gt;Feasibility Study&lt;/em&gt; suggests, we would be happy to transfer much of CEEMID’s content to the European Data Observatory, which could potentially fill up about 50-70% of the envisioned observatory.  We are building our Demo Music Observatory based on the 2000 pan-European indicators collected by CEEMID since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Illusory data gap: active and music participation is available on EU level both for gender groups or four ethnic minorities – this is regularly featured in various European CAP surveys and in our national CAP surveys, too.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Feasibility Study is based on perceived data gaps between data needs of the European stakeholders and data availability. We have shown earlier this year to the European stakeholders that much of these data gaps are &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-01-30-ceereport/#invisibility&#34;&gt;illusory&lt;/a&gt;. We would like to give about 50 indicators with full documentation, automated, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual refreshment for free for all music industry users. We would like to challenge the stakeholders to formulate data requests to us and think together on the ways how could the European music industry build a better observatory faster and with less cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Challenge Our Demo Observatory&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Check out the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.music.dataobservatory.eu/music-economy.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Economy Pillar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;of our Demo Music Observatory.  If you do not find what you are looking for,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/#contact&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;contact us&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; &lt;em&gt;we will try to put the data there from our repositories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Feasibility Study concludes that a “European Music Observatory would require a very significant allocation of funds, beyond what could be currently expected from the possible budget of the future Creative Europe programme”.   While the Feasibility Study provide cost options, or any cost-benefit analysis, we are certain that this is an exaggeration.  Most European data observatories operate with an annual 20,000-200,000-euro subsidy.  We want to show with our Demo Music Observatory what can be achieved with an annual budget of 20,000 euros, 50,000 euros, 100,000 euros or 200,000 euros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
