      <title>dataset: Create Interoperable FAIR Datasets</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/software/dataset/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/software/dataset/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;interoperable-fair-datasets&#34;&gt;Interoperable, FAIR datasets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary aim of dataset is create well-referenced, well-described,
interoperable datasets from data.frames, tibbles or data.tables that
translate well into the W3C DataSet definition within the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Data Cube
Vocabulary&lt;/a&gt; in a reproducible
manner. The data cube model in itself is is originated in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://sdmx.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange&lt;/a&gt;, and it is
almost fully harmonzied with the Resource Description Framework (RDF),
the standard model for data interchange on the web[^1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mapping of R objects into these models has numerous advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes data importing easier and less error-prone;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaves plenty of room for documentation automation, resulting in far
better reusability and reproducability;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The publication of results from R following the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FAIR&lt;/a&gt; principles is far
easier, making the work of the R user more findable, more
accessible, more interoperable and more reusable by other users;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes the placement into relational databases, semantic web
applications, archives, repositories possible without time-consuming
and costly data wrangling (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/RDF.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;From dataset To
RDF&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our package functions work with any structured R objects (data.fame,
data.table, tibble, or well-structured lists like json), however, the
best functionality is achieved by the (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataset.dataobservatory.eu/articles/dataset.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;The dataset S3
Class&lt;/a&gt;), which
is inherited from &lt;code&gt;data.frame()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;code-of-conduct&#34;&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that the &lt;code&gt;dataset&lt;/code&gt; project is released with a

      <title>statcodelists: Use Standardized Statistical Codelists</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/software/statcodelists/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;retrospective-data-harmonization&#34;&gt;Retrospective data harmonization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of &lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; is to provide tools for reproducible
retrospective (ex-post) harmonization of datasets that contain variables
measuring the same concepts but coded in different ways. Ex-post data
harmonization enables better use of existing data and creates new
research opportunities. For example, harmonizing data from different
countries enables cross-national comparisons, while merging data from
different time points makes it possible to track changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrospective data harmonization is associated with challenges including
conceptual issues with establishing equivalence and comparability,
practical complications of having to standardize the naming and coding
of variables, technical difficulties with merging data stored in
different formats, and the need to document a large number of data
transformations. The &lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; package assists with the latter
three components, freeing up the capacity of researchers to focus on the
first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the &lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; package proposes a reproducible
workflow, including a new class for storing data together with the
harmonized and original metadata, as well as functions for importing
data from different formats, harmonizing data and metadata, documenting
the harmonization process, and converting between data types. See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/reference/retrohamonize.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
for an overview of the functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;code&gt;labelled_spss_survey()&lt;/code&gt; class is an extension of &lt;a href=&#34;https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/labelled_spss.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;haven’s labelled_spss class&lt;/a&gt;. It not
only preserves variable and value labels and the user-defined missing
range, but also gives an identifier, for example, the filename or the
wave number, to the vector. Additionally, it enables the preservation –
as metadata attributes – of the original variable names, labels, and
value codes and labels, from the source data, in addition to the
harmonized variable names, labels, and value codes and labels. This way,
the harmonized data also contain the pre-harmonization record. The
stored original metadata can be used for validation and documentation
purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vignette &lt;a href=&#34;https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/labelled_spss_survey.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Working With The labelled_spss_survey Class&lt;/a&gt;
provides more information about the &lt;code&gt;labelled_spss_survey()&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/harmonize_labels.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Harmonize Value Labels&lt;/a&gt;
we discuss the characteristics of the &lt;code&gt;labelled_spss_survey()&lt;/code&gt; class and
demonstrates the problems that using this class solves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also provide three extensive case studies illustrating how the
&lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; package can be used for ex-post harmonization of data
from cross-national surveys:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Empirical Analysis of Music Streaming Revenues and Their Distribution</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/publication/mce_empirical_streaming_2021/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/publication/mce_empirical_streaming_2021/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Owing to the global nature of music earnings, the various currency translation and royalty payments applied, and because there is no global comprehensive database of rights-holders, works, and recordings, it is impossible to calculate average (mean) or typical (median) earnings with any accuracy. Even an estimate would require a very complex methodology. Understanding the earnings of an average rights-holder would require a careful disaggregation of volume, price, exchange rate, and distribution changes, and international data harmonisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimating average or typical income requires advanced empirical sampling or surveying methods. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; (previously CEEMID) has worked on developing such methods, with the support of the state51 music group. We commissioned a report from the Digital Music Observatory on the earnings of UK rights-holders and this can be found here at &lt;a href=&#34;https://zenodo.org/record/5554089&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;the Digital Music Observatory&amp;rsquo;s Zenodo repository&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;  Among the Observatory’s findings are that use of streaming services is generally growing in terms of volume, but the price is diminishing, which leads to diminishing or flat earnings for a typical or average British rights-holder; that in the 2015-2019 period, falling prices were partly or fully compensated by favourable changes in the exchange rate of the British pound with major currencies used in the global music business (the US dollar, the euro and the Japanese yen), but since 2020 there may have been changes in the opposite direction; and that for various methodological reasons, without international data harmonisation, and survey harmonisation, it is impossible to take a fully representative, unbiased sample of music
creator earnings in the United Kingdom alone.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Music Creator&amp;rsquo;s Earnings in the Digital Era, p28.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;exectuive-summary-of-our-research-document&#34;&gt;Exectuive Summary of Our Research Document&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research questions asked in this report are related to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/music-creators-earnings-in-the-digital-era&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Creator Earnings&amp;rsquo; Project&lt;/a&gt; (MCE), exploring issues concerning equitable remuneration and earnings distributions. We were tasked with providing a longitudinal analysis of earnings development and relating our findings to equitable remuneration. The starting point of our work was centred around a very broadly defined problem: how much money music creators (rightsholders) earn from streaming, how these earnings are distributed, and how the earnings and their distribution have developed during the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highly globalized music industry generates two important international reports, as well as several national reports, but these are not suitable for the analysis of the typical or average rightsholder, nor for small labels and publishers who do not represent a large and internationally diversified portfolio of music works or recordings. Copyright and neighboring right revenues are collected in national jurisdictions. Because British artists are almost never constrained by their use of language, and the UK Music Industry is highly competitive in the global music markets, even relatively less known rightsholders earn revenues from dozens of national markets. The lack of market information on music sales volumes, prices for each jurisdiction, and the unaccounted for national, domestic, and foreign revenues makes the analysis of the rightholder’s earnings, or the economics of a certain distribution channel like music streaming or media platforms, impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While total earnings are reported by international and national organizations, they hide five important economic variables: changes in sales volumes, changes in prices, market share on various national jurisdictions (which have their own volume and price movements), the exchange rates applied, and the share of the repertoire exploited. Even worse, the global music industry has no comprehensive database of rightsholders, music works, and recordings. Many rights are represented by heirs or passive investors. And because of the enormous number of works and recordings, in any given royalty payment period, most works/recordings are not used and not compensated. The lack of a known population and distribution makes usual indicators as average or median earnings arithmetically impossible to compute, and the large number of disused works and recordings makes even the estimation of the typical (median) value useless for economic analysis. The estimation of the arithmetic mean is equally problematic, because it is distorted by the earnings of very few global stars. To understand the streaming economy from the perspective of a typical or average rightsholder, or from the perspective of a small independent label or music publisher, requires very challenging sampling techniques either in surveying or in empirically observing and aggregating data from royalty accounts. National and international music organizations are not equipped with the data processing and statistical capacity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the problem that the Digital Music Observatory, a working demo of the European Music Observatory is solving. It grew out of the Central &amp;amp; Eastern European Music Industry Databases (CEEMID) initiative in 2014, in which righthsolders from three countries attempted to solve this problem. By 2019, CEEMID had collected information on 20 European markets, including the United Kingdom, and processed data on far more markets. The state51 music group, through its distribution arm, has been supporting the creation of the largest ever European market report, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Central European Market Report&lt;/a&gt;, and supported the creation of the CEEMID-CI indexes, which, for the first time provided a stock-index type of view from an individual rightsholder’s perspective on volume and price movements in the UK and in other countries. The state51 music group drew attention to the observatory approach and this work in the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS) Select Committee of the British House of Commons. The MCE project first individually contacted the Digital Music Observatory (successor of CEEMID) and state51, and eventually with the permission of state51, the project commissioned this report, which re-uses the CEEMID-CI indexes. The MCE project also committed to share data in the Digital Music Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first chapter is divided into three subchapters: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/intro.html#theoretical-challenges&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1.1&lt;/a&gt; the theoretical problems imposed by copyright law and intellectual property valuation methods; &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/intro.html#policy-issues&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1.2&lt;/a&gt; policy issues related to the copyright management problems that lead to large amounts of unpaid royalties and value transfer, as well as potential problems with AI distribution systems and royalty distribution rules; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/intro.html#empirical-challenges&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;1.3&lt;/a&gt; identifying and offering solutions for empirical problems in estimating the relevant earnings indicators for individual rightsholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second chapter presents the CEEMID-CI indexes, and gives an explanation to the seemingly paradoxical situation of total market growth, and the feeling of individual righthsolders that their earnings remain flat or decreasing. We show in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/empirical.html#streaming-value&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2.1&lt;/a&gt; that revenues that are flat or slightly growing are caused by growing volumes and falling prices (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/empirical.html#streaming-volume&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2.2 https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/empirical.html#streaming-volume&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/empirical.html#streaming-price&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;2.3  CEEMID-CI Streaming Price Index&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third chapter, using computer simulations, gives a fuller picture. It shows that in the UK and many other markets, in the period of 2016-2019, the growth of streaming use hardly offset the diminishing price (value) of the streams. In many markets, rightsholders, expressed in British pounds, experienced flat earnings, which was by a large extent due to the benevolent USD/GBP, EUR/GBP, and CHF/GBP exchange rates. It is likely that the majority of individual rightsholders experienced flat or diminishing revenues, and later releases brought less and less revenue per a thousand streams. A less benevolent exchange rate environment could have brought very large losses of revenue (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/simulation-results.html#exchange-rate-effects&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;3.4&lt;/a&gt; for more details.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our computer simulations show that British rightsholders are experiencing a rather varied picture of music streaming. Because of the generally falling value of streams, short-lived hits are more impacted by value decline than perennial hits (See subchapters &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/simulation-results.html#difference-popularity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;3.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/simulation-results.html#release-time&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;3.2&lt;/a&gt;.) Rightsholders with a diversified international audience are partly shielded by these effects (See &lt;a href=&#34;https://mce.dataobservatory.eu/simulation-results.html#difference-international&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;3.3&lt;/a&gt;.) Younger stars and new genres generally experience a windfall from the pro-rata distribution system and older artists with more conventional genres such as rock or blues are experiencing headwinds. The publicly available market totals are hiding completely different market experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MCE project and its stakeholders did not provide us with any data. Our detailed data from other jurisdictions, however, shows that music streaming has been successfully competing with other sales/distribution formats of music partly because it was much cheaper, and generally devalued music-related rights. This is particularly the case with media platforms like YouTube. For the UK, which is not planning to adopt new EU regulations, closing the value gap is an important policy task. We also show on the example of other countries that current policy debate in the UK around the re-definition of equitable remuneration rigths, or on the pro-rata or user-centrique distribution schemes, are gaining excessive focus, and changes in these aspects of the streaming ecosystem will solve the problems of few, if any, rightsholders. We believe that the music industry must look beyond the current practices of streaming pricing and distribution, for example, to telecommunication services, and investigate the adoption of a more just system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our report highlights some important lessons. First, we show that in the era of global music sales platforms it is impossible to understand the economics of music streaming without international data harmonization and advanced surveying and sampling. Paradoxically, without careful adjustments for accruals, market shares in jurisdictions, and disaggregation of price and volume changes, the British industry cannot analyze its own economics because of its high level of integration to the global music economy. Furthermore, the replacement of former public performances, mechanical licensing, and private copying remunerations (which has been available for British rightsholders in their European markets for decades) with less valuable streaming licenses has left many rightsholders poorer. Making adjustments on the distribution system without modifying the definition of equitable remuneration rights or the pro-rata distribution scheme of streaming platforms opens up many conflicts while solving not enough fundamental problems.  Therefore, we suggest participation in international data harmonization and policy coordination to help regain the historical value of music.&lt;/p&gt;

How can we measure the market share of the Slovak music in the domestic and foreign markets?

Weighing costs and benefits, there can be little doubt that new data improvement initiatives and sufficient investment in a better copyright data infrastructure should play a central role in EU copyright policy. A trade-off between data harmonisation and interoperability on the one hand, and transparency and accountability of content recommender systems on the other, could pave the way for successful new initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2021 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-06-03-iotables-release/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have released a new version of
&lt;a href=&#34;https://iotables.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;iotables&lt;/a&gt; as part of the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ropengov.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rOpenGov&lt;/a&gt; project. The package, as the name
suggests, works with European symmetric input-output tables (SIOTs).
SIOTs are among the most complex governmental statistical products. They
show how each country’s 64 agricultural, industrial, service, and
sometimes household sectors relate to each other. They are estimated
from various components of the GDP, tax collection, at least every five
years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIOTs offer great value to policy-makers and analysts to make more than
educated guesses on how a million euros, pounds or Czech korunas spent
on a certain sector will impact other sectors of the economy, employment
or GDP. What happens when a bank starts to give new loans and advertise
them? How is an increase in economic activity going to affect the amount
of wages paid and and where will consumers most likely spend their
wages? As the national economies begin to reopen after COVID-19 pandemic
lockdowns, is to utilize SIOTs to calculate direct and indirect
employment effects or value added effects of government grant programs
to sectors such as cultural and creative industries or actors such as
venues for performing arts, movie theaters, bars and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making such calculations requires a bit of matrix algebra, and
understanding of input-output economics, direct, indirect effects, and
multipliers. Economists, grant designers, policy makers have those
skills, but until now, such calculations were either made in cumbersome
Excel sheets, or proprietary software, as the key to these calculations
is to keep vectors and matrices, which have at least one dimension of
64, perfectly aligned. We made this process reproducible with
&lt;a href=&#34;https://iotables.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;iotables&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=eurostat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;eurostat&lt;/a&gt; on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ropengov.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rOpenGov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;accessing-and-tidying-the-data-programmatically&#34;&gt;Accessing and tidying the data programmatically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iotables package is in a way an extension to the &lt;em&gt;eurostat&lt;/em&gt; R
package, which provides a programmatic access to the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eurostat&lt;/a&gt; data warehouse. The reason for
releasing a new package is that working with SIOTs requires plenty of
meticulous data wrangling based on various &lt;em&gt;metadata&lt;/em&gt; sources, apart
from actually accessing the &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt; itself. When working with matrix
equations, the bar is higher than with tidy data. Not only your rows and
columns must match, but their ordering must strictly conform the
quadrants of the a matrix system, including the connecting trade or tax
matrices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you download a country’s SIOT table, you receive a long form data
frame, a very-very long one, which contains the matrix values and their
labels like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Table naio_10_cp1700 cached at C:\Users\...\Temp\RtmpGQF4gr/eurostat/naio_10_cp1700_date_code_FF.rds

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metadata reads like this: the units are in millions of euros, we are
analyzing domestic flows, and the national account items &lt;code&gt;B1-B2&lt;/code&gt; for the
industry &lt;code&gt;A01&lt;/code&gt;. The information of a 64x64 matrix (the SIOT) and its
connecting matrices, such as taxes, or employment, or &lt;em&gt;C**O&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
emissions, must be placed exactly in one correct ordering of columns and
rows. Every single data wrangling error will usually lead in an error
(the matrix equation has no solution), or, what is worse, in a very
difficult to trace algebraic error. Our package not only labels this
data meaningfully, but creates very tidy data frames that contain each
necessary matrix of vector with a key column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iotables package contains the vocabularies (abbreviations and human
readable labels) of three statistical vocabularies: the so called
&lt;code&gt;COICOP&lt;/code&gt; product codes, the &lt;code&gt;NACE&lt;/code&gt; industry codes, and the vocabulary of
the &lt;code&gt;ESA2010&lt;/code&gt; definition of national accounts (which is the government
equivalent of corporate accounting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our package currently solves all equations for direct, indirect effects,
multipliers and inter-industry linkages. Backward linkages show what
happens with the suppliers of an industry, such as catering or
advertising in the case of music festivals, if the festivals reopen. The
forward linkages show how much extra demand this creates for connecting
services that treat festivals as a ‘supplier’, such as cultural tourism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-seen-an-example&#34;&gt;Let’s seen an example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Downloading employment data from the Eurostat database.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and match it with the latest structural information on from the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?wai=true&amp;amp;dataset=naio_10_cp1700&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Symmetric input-output table at basic prices (product by
product)&lt;/a&gt;
Eurostat product. A quick look at the Eurostat website already shows
that there is a lot of work ahead to make the data look like an actual
Symmetric input-output table. Download it with &lt;code&gt;iotable_get()&lt;/code&gt; which
does basic labelling and preprocessing on the raw Eurostat files.
Because of the size of the unfiltered dataset on Eurostat, the following
code may take several minutes to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;sk_io &amp;lt;-  iotable_get ( labelled_io_data = NULL, 
                        source = &amp;quot;naio_10_cp1700&amp;quot;, geo = &amp;quot;SK&amp;quot;, 
                        year = 2015, unit = &amp;quot;MIO_EUR&amp;quot;, 
                        stk_flow = &amp;quot;TOTAL&amp;quot;,
                        labelling = &amp;quot;iotables&amp;quot; )

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;input_coefficient_matrix_create()&lt;/code&gt; creates the input coefficient
matrix, which is used for most of the analytical functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;i**j&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;i**j&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; / &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;j&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It checks the correct ordering of columns, and furthermore it fills up 0
values with 0.000001 to avoid division with zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;input_coeff_matrix_sk &amp;lt;- input_coefficient_matrix_create(
  data_table = sk_io
)

## Columns and rows of real_estate_imputed_a, extraterriorial_organizations are all zeros and will be removed.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you can create the Leontieff-inverse, which contains all the
structural information about the relationships of 64x64 sectors of the
chosen country, in this case, Slovakia, ready for the main equations of
input-output economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I_sk &amp;lt;- leontieff_inverse_create(input_coeff_matrix_sk)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And take out the primary inputs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;primary_inputs_sk &amp;lt;- coefficient_matrix_create(
  data_table = sk_io, 
  total = &#39;output&#39;, 
  return = &#39;primary_inputs&#39;)

## Columns and rows of real_estate_imputed_a, extraterriorial_organizations are all zeros and will be removed.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s see if there the government tries to stimulate the economy in
three sectors, agricultulre, car manufacturing, and R&amp;amp;D with a billion
euros. Direct effects measure the initial, direct impact of the change
in demand and supply for a product. When production goes up, it will
create demand in all supply industries (backward linkages) and create
opportunities in the industries that use the product themselves (forward
linkages.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;direct_effects_create( primary_inputs_sk, I_sk ) %&amp;gt;%
  select ( all_of(c(&amp;quot;iotables_row&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;agriculture&amp;quot;,

  filter (.data$iotables_row %in% c(&amp;quot;gva_effect&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;wages_salaries_effect&amp;quot;, 
                                    &amp;quot;imports_effect&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;output_effect&amp;quot;))

##            iotables_row agriculture motor_vechicles research_development

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car manufacturing requires much imported components, so each extra
demand will create a large importing activity. The R&amp;amp;D will create a the
most local wages (and supports most jobs) because research is
job-intensive. As we can see, the effect on imports, wages, gross value
added (which will end up in the GDP) and output changes are very
different in these three sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the total effect, because some of the increased production
will translate into income, which in turn will be used to create further
demand in all parts of the domestic economy. The total effect is
characterized by multipliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then solve for the multipliers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;multipliers_sk &amp;lt;- input_multipliers_create( 
  primary_inputs_sk %&amp;gt;%
    filter (.data$iotables_row == &amp;quot;gva&amp;quot;), I_sk ) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And select a few industries:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;set.seed(12)

  tidyr::pivot_longer ( -all_of(&amp;quot;iotables_row&amp;quot;),

provides an introduction of input-output economics and re-creates the
examples of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://iotables.dataobservatory.eu/articles/germany_1990.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Eurostat Manual of Supply, Use and Input-Output
Tables&lt;/a&gt;,
by Jörg Beutel (Eurostat Manual).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://iotables.dataobservatory.eu/articles/united_kingdom_2010.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;United Kingdom Input-Output Analytical Tables Daniel Antal, based
on the work edited by Richard
Wild&lt;/a&gt;
is a use case on how to correctly import data from outside Eurostat
(i.e. not with &lt;code&gt;eurostat::get_eurostat()&lt;/code&gt;) and join it properly to a
SIOT. We also used this example to create unit tests of our functions
from a published, official government statistical release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href=&#34;https://iotables.dataobservatory.eu/articles/working_with_eurostat.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Working With Eurostat
Data&lt;/a&gt;
is a detailed use case of working with all the current functionalities
of the package by comparing two economies, Czechia and Slovakia and
guides you through a lot more examples than this short blogpost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our package was originally developed to calculate GVA and employment
effects for the Slovak music industry (see our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Slovak Music Industry Report&lt;/a&gt;), and similar calculations for the
Hungarian film tax shelter. We can now programatically create
reproducible multipliers for all European economies in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Digital
Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, and create
further indicators for economic policy making in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://economy.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Economy Data
Observatory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;environmental-impact-analysis&#34;&gt;Environmental Impact Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our package allows the calculation of various economic policy scenarios,
such as changing the VAT on meat or effects of re-opening music
festivals on aggregate demand, GDP, tax revenues, or employment. But
what about the &lt;em&gt;C**O&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, methane and other greenhouse gas
effects of the reopening festivals, or the increasing meat prices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technically our package can already calculate such effects, but to do
so, you have to carefully match further statistical vocabulary items
used by the European Environmental Agency about air pollutants and
greenhouse gases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last released version of &lt;em&gt;iotables&lt;/em&gt; is Importing and Manipulating
Symmetric Input-Output Tables (Version 0.4.4). Zenodo.

but we are alread working on a new major release. In that release, we
are planning to build in the necessary vocabulary into the metadata
functions to increase the functionality of the package, and create new
indicators for our &lt;a href=&#34;https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Green Deal Data
Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. This experimental
data observatory is creating new, high quality statistical indicators
from open governmental and open science data sources that has not seen
the daylight yet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reprex, a Dutch start-up enterprise formed to utilize open source software and open data, is looking for partners in an agile, open collaboration to win at least one of the three EU Datathon Prizes. We are looking for policy partners, academic partners and a consultancy partner. Our project is based on agile, open collaboration with three types of contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With our competing prototypes we want to show that we have a research automation technology that can find open data, process it and validate it into high-quality business, policy or scientific indicators, and release it with daily refreshments in a modern API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are looking for institutions to challenge us with their data problems, and sponsors to increase our capacity. Over then next 5 months, we need to find a sustainable business model for a high-quality and open alternative to other public data programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-eu-datathon-2021-challenge&#34;&gt;The EU Datathon 2021 Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To take part, you should propose the development of an application that links and uses open datasets.&lt;/em&gt; - our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/#contributors&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data curator team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your application &amp;hellip; is also expected to find suitable new approaches and solutions to help Europe achieve important goals set by the European Commission through the use of open data.&lt;/em&gt;” - this application is developed by our &lt;a href=&#34;https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/#contributors&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;technology contributors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your application should showcase opportunities for concrete business models or social enterprises.&lt;/em&gt; - our &lt;a href=&#34;https://economy.dataobservatory.eu/#contributors&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;service development team&lt;/a&gt; is working to make this happen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use open source software and open data. The applications are hosted on the cloud resources of &lt;a href=&#34;#reprex&#34;&gt;Reprex&lt;/a&gt;, an early-stage technology startup currently building a viable, open-source, open-data business model to create reproducible research products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are working together with experts in the domain as curators (check out our guidelines if you want to join: &lt;a href=&#34;https://curators.dataobservatory.eu/data-curators.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Data Curators: Get Inspired!&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our development team works on an open collaboration basis. Our indicator R packages, and our services are developed together with &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/author/ropengov/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rOpenGov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mission-statement&#34;&gt;Mission statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to win an &lt;a href=&#34;https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eudatathon&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;EU Datathon prize&lt;/a&gt; by processing the vast, already-available governmental and scientific open data made usable for policy-makers, scientific researchers, and business researcher end-users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Climate change and environmental degradation are an existential threat to Europe and the world. To overcome these challenges, the European Union created the European Green Deal strategic plan, which aims to make the EU’s economy sustainable by turning climate and environmental challenges into opportunities and making the transition just and inclusive for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;http://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Green Deal Data Observatory&lt;/a&gt; is a modern reimagination of existing ‘data observatories’; currently, there are over 70 permanent international data collection and dissemination points. One of our objectives is to understand why the dozens of the EU’s observatories do not use open data and reproducible research. We want to show that open governmental data, open science, and reproducible research can lead to a higher quality and faster data ecosystem that fosters growth for policy, business, and academic data users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide high quality, tidy data through a modern API which enables data flows between public and proprietary databases. We believe that introducing Open Policy Analysis standards with open data, open-source software, and research automation, can help the Green Deal policymaking process. Our collaboration is open for individuals, citizens scientists, research institutes, NGOS, and companies.&lt;/p&gt;

Modernising our standards system, 2. Consolidating Europe’s intellectual property framework, and 3. Enabling the balanced development of the collaborative economy strategic goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big data and automation create new inequalities and injustices and have the potential to create a jobless growth economy. Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://economy.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Economy Data Observatory&lt;/a&gt; is a fully automated, open source, open data observatory that produces new indicators from open data sources and experimental big data sources, with authoritative copies and a modern API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our observatory monitors the European economy to protect consumers and small companies from unfair competition, both from data and knowledge monopolization and robotization. We take a critical Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME)-, intellectual property, and competition policy point of view of automation, robotization, and the AI revolution on the service-oriented European social market economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to create early-warning, risk, economic effect, and impact indicators that can be used in scientific, business, and policy contexts for professionals who are working on re-setting the European economy after a devastating pandemic in the age of AI. We are particularly interested in designing indicators that can be early warnings for killer acquisitions, algorithmic and offline discrimination against consumers based on nationality or place of residence, and signs of undermining key economic and competition policy goals. Our goal is to help small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups to grow, and to furnish data that encourages the financial sector to provide loans and equity funds for their growth.&lt;/p&gt;

It provides high-quality and timely indicators in all four pillars of the planned official European Music Observatory as a modern, open source and largely open data-based, automated, API-supported alternative solution for this planned observatory. The insight and methodologies we are refining in the DMO are applicable and transferable to about 60 other data observatories funded by the EU which do not currently employ governmental or scientific open data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music is one of the most data-driven service industries where most sales are currently executed by AI-driven autonomous systems that influence market shares and intellectual property remuneration. We provide a template that enables making these AI-driven systems accountable and trustworthy, with the goal of re-balancing the legitimate interests of creators, distributors, and consumers. Within Europe, this new balance will be an important use case of the European Data Strategy and the Digital Services Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DMO is a fully functional service that can serve as a testing ground of the European Data Strategy. It can showcase the ways in which the music industry is affected by the problems that the Digital Services Act and European Trustworthy AI initiatives attempt to regulate.

We are currently developing this project with the help of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jumpmusic.eu/fellow2021/automated-music-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;JUMP European Music Market Accelerator&lt;/a&gt; program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem-statement&#34;&gt;Problem Statement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU has an 18-year-old open data regime and it makes public taxpayer-funded data in the values of tens of billions of euros per year; the Eurostat program alone handles 20,000 international data products, including at least 5,000 pan-European environmental indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As open science principles gain increased acceptance, scientific researchers are making hundreds of thousands of valuable datasets public and available for replication every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU, the OECD, and UN institutions run around 100 data collection programs, so-called ‘data observatories’ that more or less avoid touching this data, and buy proprietary data instead. Annually, each observatory spends between 50 thousand and 3 million EUR on collecting untidy and proprietary data of inconsistent quality, while never even considering open data.&lt;/p&gt;
















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-our-automated-data-observatories-are-modern-reimaginations-of-the-existing-observatories-that-do-not-use-open-data-and-research-automation&#34;&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://reprex.nl/media/img/observatory_screenshots/observatory_collage_16x9_800.png&#34; alt=&#34;Our automated data observatories are modern reimaginations of the existing observatories that do not use open data and research automation.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      Our automated data observatories are modern reimaginations of the existing observatories that do not use open data and research automation.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with the current EU data strategy is that while it produces enormous quantities of valuable open data, in the absence of common basic data science and documentation principles, it seems often cheaper to create new data than to put the existing open data into shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an absolute waste of resources and efforts. With a few R packages and our deep understanding of advanced data science techniques, we can create valuable datasets from unprocessed open data. In most domains, we are able to repurpose data originally created for other purposes at a historical cost of several billions of euros, converting these unused data assets into valuable datasets that can replace tens of millions’ worth of proprietary data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we want to achieve with this project – and we believe such an accomplishment would merit one of the first prizes - is to add value to a significant portion of pre-existing EU open data (for example, available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.europa.eu/data/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data.europa.eu/data&lt;/a&gt;) by re-processing and integrating them into a modern, tidy database with an API access, and to find a business model that emphasises a triangular use of data in 1. business, 2. science and 3. policy-making. Our mission is to modernize the concept of &lt;code&gt;data observatories.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recommendation Systems: What can Go Wrong with the Algorithm?</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-05-16-recommendation-outcomes/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 07:10:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-05-16-recommendation-outcomes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Traitors in a war used to be executed by firing squad, and it was a psychologically burdensome task for soldiers to have to shoot former comrades. When a 10-marksman squad fired 8 blank and 2 live ammunition, the traitor would be 100% dead, and the soldiers firing would walk away with a semblance of consolation in the fact they had an 80% chance of not having been the one that killed a former comrade. This is a textbook example of assigning responsibility and blame in systems. AI-driven systems such as the YouTube or Spotify recommendation systems, the shelf organization of Amazon books, or the workings of a stock photo agency come together through complex processes, and when they produce undesirable results, or, on the contrary, they improve life, it is difficult to assign blame or credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the edited text of my presentation on Copyright Data Improvement in the EU – Towards Better Visibility of European
Content and Broader Licensing Opportunities in the Light of New Technologies&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/documents/Copyright_Data_Improvement_Workshop_Programme.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;download the entire webinar&amp;rsquo;s agenda&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://reprex.nl/media/presentations/D_Antal_IVIR_Webinar_2021-05-06/Slide2.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Assigning and avoding blame.&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      Assigning and avoding blame.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not see enough women on streaming charts, or if you think that the percentage of European films on your favorite streaming provider—or Slovak music on your music streaming service—is too low, you have to be able to distribute the blame in more precise terms than just saying “it’s the system” that is stacked up against women, small countries, or other groups. We need to be able to point the blame more precisely in order to effect change through economic incentives or legal constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is precisely the type of work we are doing with the continued support of the Slovak national rightsholder organizations, as well as in our research in the United Kingdom. We try to understand why classical musicians are paid less, or why 15% of Slovak, Estonian, Dutch, and Hungarian artists never appear on anybody’s personalized recommendations. We need to understand how various AI-driven systems operate, and one approach would at the very least model and assign blame for undesirable outcomes in probabilistic terms. The problem is usually not that an algorithm is nasty and malicious; Algorithms are often trained through “machine learning” techniques, and often, machines “learn” from biased, faulty, or low-quality information.&lt;/p&gt;

      Outcomes: What Can Go Wrong With a Recommendation System?
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In complex systems there are hardly ever singular causes that explain undesired outcomes; in the case of algorithmic bias in music streaming, there is no single bullet that eliminates women from charts or makes Slovak or Estonian language content less valuable than that in English. Some apparent causes may in fact be “blank cartridges,” and the real fire might come from unexpected directions. Systematic, robust approaches are needed in order to understand what it is that may be working against female or non-cisgender artists, long-tail works, or small-country repertoires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of “undesirable outcomes” in recommendation engines might include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recommending too small a proportion of female or small country artists; or recommending artists that promote hate and violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Placing Slovak books on lower shelves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making the works of major labels easier to find than those of independent labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Placing a lower number of European works on your favorite video or music streaming platform’s start window than local television or radio regulations would require.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filling up your social media newsfeed with fake news about covid-19 spread by some malevolent agents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These undesirable outcomes are sometimes illegal as they may go against non-discrimination or competition law. (See our ideas on what can go wrong &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/music_level_playing_field_2021/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?&lt;/a&gt;) They may undermine national or EU-level cultural policy goals, media regulation, child protection rules, and fundamental rights protection against discrimination without basis. They may make Slovak artists earn significantly less than American artists.&lt;/p&gt;

      Metadata problems: no single bullet theory
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/listen_local_2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;work in Slovakia&lt;/a&gt;, we reverse engineered some of these undesirable outcomes. Popular video and music streaming recommendation systems have at least three major components based on machine learning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The users’ history – Is it that users’ history is sexist, or perhaps the training metadata database is skewed against women?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The works’ characteristics – are Dvorak’s works as well documented for the algorithm as Taylor Swift’s or Drake’s?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independent information from the internet – Does the internet write less about women artists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the making of a recommendation or an autonomous playlist, these sources of information can be seen as “metadata” concerning a copyright-protected work (as well as its right-protected recorded fixation.) More often than not, we are not facing a malicious algorithm when we see undesirable system outcomes. The usual problem is that the algorithm is learning from data that is historically biased against women or biased for British and American artists, or that it is only able to find data in English language film and music reviews.
Metadata plays an incredibly important role in supporting or undermining general music education, media policy, copyright policy, or competition rules. If a video or music steaming platform’s algorithm is unaware of the music that music educators find suitable for Slovak or Estonian teenagers, then it will not recommend that music to your child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, metadata is very costly. In the case of cultural heritage, European states and the EU itself have been traditionally investing in metadata with each technological innovation. For Dvorak’s or Beethoven’s works, various library descriptions were made in the analogue world, then work and recording identifiers were assigned to CDs and mp3s, and eventually we must describe them again in a way intelligible for contemporary autonomous systems. In the case of classical music and literature, early cinema, or reproductions of artworks, we have public funding schemes for this work.  But this seems not to be enough. In the current economy of streaming, the increasingly low income generated by  most European works is insufficient to even cover the cost of proper documentation, which then sends that part of the European repertoire into a self-fulfilling oblivion: the algorithm cannot “learn” its properties and it never shows these works to users and audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, in most cases, it was assumed that it is the artists or their representative’s duty to provide high quality metadata, but in the analogue era, or in the era of individual digital copies, we did not anticipate that the sales value will not even cover the documentation cost. We must find technical solutions with interoperability and new economic incentives to create proper metadata for Europe’s cultural products. With that, we can cover one area out of the three possible problem terrains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is not enough. We need to address the question of how new, better Algorithms can learn from user history and avoid amplifying pre-existing bias against women or hateful speech. We need to make sure that when Algorithms are “scraping” the internet, they do so in an accountable way that does not make small language repertoires vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;

The need for further research on how these large systems affect various fundamental rights, consumer or competition rights, or cultural and media policy goals cannot be overstated. The first step is to open and understand these autonomous systems. It is not enough to say that the firing squads of Big Tech are shooting women out from charts, ethnic minority artists from screens, and small language authors from the virtual bookshelves. We must put a lot more effort on researching the sources of the problems that make machine learning Algorithms behave in a way that is not compatible with our European values or regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia &amp; Abroad</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-03-26-listen-local-feasibility/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Mar 2021 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-help-promote-local-music&#34;&gt;How to help promote local music?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study opens the question of the local music promotion within the digital environment.
The Slovak Performing and Mechanical Rights Society (SOZA), the State51 music group in the United Kingdom, and the Slovak Arts Council commissioned Reprex to created a feasibility study which provides recommendations for better use of quotas for Slovak radio stations and which also maps the share and promotion of Slovak music within large streaming and media platforms such as Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
















&lt;figure  id=&#34;figure-what-should-a-good-local-content-policy-radio-quota-recommendation-system-streaming-quota-achieve&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;

      What should a good local content policy (radio quota, recommendation system, streaming quota) achieve?
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study proposes best practices for the introduction of mandatory quotas for Slovak radio stations and points out how current recommendation systems used by large platforms such as Spotify, YouTube, or Apple hardly consider local music from smaller countries. Local music stands against competition consisting of million songs from the whole world, and for ordinary Slovak musicians, whose music doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong to the global hits playlists, it is almost impossible to get recommended by the recommendation systems of large platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;listen-local-app-for-discovering-new-music&#34;&gt;Listen Local App for discovering new music&lt;/h2&gt;

      We aimed to create a demo version of a utility-based, transparent, accountable recommendation system.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution to this problem could be the Listen Local App, built on a comprehensive reference database of local music, which we created as a demo version within the study. The app aims to help listeners discover more local music; the app also presents new and alternative ways for large digital platforms to recommend local artists. Through Listen Local, listeners search for artists and bands based on their taste and the city they are situated in. In this way, listeners can easily search for music by artists from particular cities or from the town they are about to visit.
We are releasing today the feasibility study in English and Slovak. We call for an open consultation to evaluate the results of this work and continue developing the Slovak Music Database, the Listen Local recommendation, and the AI validation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/project/demo-app/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Listen Local App&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;database&#34;&gt;Database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Slovak Music Database is connected to Reprex&amp;rsquo;s flagship project, the Demo Music Observatory, an open collaboration-based demo version of the planned European Music Observatory, currently being further developed in the JUMP Music Market Accelerator Programme supported by Music Moves Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project website contains the &lt;a href=&#34;https://listenlocal.community/project/demo-sk-music-db/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;demo version of the Slovak Music Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-steps&#34;&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next phase of the work, we add further data to our Slovak Demo Music Database and carry out more and more experiments and educational activities to understand how Slovak music can become more visible and targeted. We are also bringing this project into an international collaboration for better utilization of R&amp;amp;D efforts and experiences throughout Europe. This agile project method originated in reproducible scientific practice and open-source software development and allows participation in large projects on any scale: from individual musicians and educators to large research universities and music distributors. Anyone can join in on the effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reprex is looking for further international partners; Reprex is currently part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-16-nlaic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Dutch AI Coalition&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european-ai-alliance&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;European AI Alliance&lt;/a&gt; project. SOZA and Reprex are committed to opening this project for international collaboration while ensuring that a significant part of the R&amp;amp;D activities remains in the Slovak Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are preparing informal, online information sessions for artists, promoters, researchers, and developers to join our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the announcement of JUMP, the European Music Market Accelerator, after a careful screening of all applications received, the selection committee composed of all JUMP board members has selected the most promising ideas and projects to be developed together with renowned tutors for this 2021 fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nine months, the 20 fellows living in many European countries will develop their innovative projects, while receiving a comprehensive 360° training. In addition to specialised workshops by highly qualified experts, each fellow will receive one-on-one tutoring sessions from the most renowned music professionals coming from all over Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20 selected projects cover a great variety of urgent needs faced within the music sector.
They will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;help fostering social change with projects focusing on diversity in the industry, more fairness and
transparency as well as raising awareness on timely issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enhance technological development with projects using blockchain, immersive sound and VR and AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;build bridges between different key actors of the ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Open Data Day Interview: Mapping Data with Milos Popovic</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-03-03-ood_interview_maps/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 22:23:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-03-03-ood_interview_maps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Milos Popovic is a researcher, a data scientist, Marie Curie postdoc &amp;amp; Top 10 dataviz &amp;amp; R contributor on Twitter according to NodeXL. He took part in policy debates about terrorism and military intervention and appeared on a number of TV channels including N1 (the CNN affiliate in the Western Balkans), Serbian National Television and Al-Jazeera Balkans. My research interests are at the intersection of civil war dynamics and postwar politics in the Balkans. He is going to join the Data &amp;amp; Lyrics team on International Open Data Day to help us put harmonized environmental degradation perception and environmental sensory data on maps. We asked him four questions about his passion, mapping data. Please join us 6 March 2021 9.30 EST / 15.30 CET for an informal digital coffee.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a researcher, why are you so much drawn into maps? Is this connected to your interest in territorial conflicts, or you have some other inspiration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a great question that really makes me pause and look back at the past 5 years. My mapping story started out of curiosity: I found interesting data on the post-WWII violence in Serbia and thought how cool it would be to make a map in R. I quickly made an unimpressive choropleth map and noticed some unexpected patterns. Then I realized just how much unused violence and census data sits out there while we have no clue about geographic patterns. So, it began. I started off with map-making but my curiosity took me to the world of georeferencing and geospatial analysis. In the process, I created over 300 maps hosted on my website as well as dozens of shapefiles from the scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think that my interest is linked to growing up in a war-torn country. But, as my map-making evolved, I discovered that my passion is to use maps as a way to democratize the data: to take the scores of unused, and often buried datasets, place them on the map and share the dataviz with people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you show us an example of the best use of mapped data, and the best map that you have personally created? What is their distinctive value?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m immensely proud of my work that required making the shapefiles from the scratch. For instance, my shapefile of over 1500 Kosovo cadastral settlements came into being after I turned dozens of high-resolution raster files into a shapefile fully compatible with Open Street Maps. After months of hard work, I managed to merge the shapefile with the 2011 Kosovo census and present several laser-focused demographic maps to my audience. Same goes for the settlement shapefile of &lt;em&gt;Republika Srpska&lt;/em&gt; [the Serb-speaking entity of Bosnia-Herzegovina — the editor], which I made out of a pdf file and merged with the 2013 census data. Whereas most existing maps take a bird’s eye view, my work offers a more fine-grained view of the local dynamics to stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another similar undertaking was my transformation of the pre-WWII German military map of Yugoslavia into a unique shapefile of a few hundred Yugoslav municipalities. I combined this shapefile with the 1931 census data, 80 years after it was first published (better late than never!). It took me almost a year to complete this tremendous project but I enjoyed every bit of it. I have teamed up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://aleksandarpopovic.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;my brother&lt;/a&gt; who is a web developer and we even made &lt;a href=&#34;https://milosp.info/maps/interactive/census1931/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;an interactive map of Yugoslavia based on the 1931 census&lt;/a&gt;.[&lt;em&gt;The screenshot of this interactive map is the top image in the post &amp;ndash; the editor&lt;/em&gt;] We hope this project would serve not only scholars but also history enthusiasts to better understand a history of the country that is no more.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think about collaboration based on open data and open-source software that processes such data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a fantastic opportunity for small teams to bypass traditional gatekeepers such as state institutions or big companies and use open source apps for the benefit of their local communities. For example, the access to Open Street Map allows small teams to map pressing communal issues as crime, deceases, or environmental degradation and come up with innovative solutions. In my work, too, I used OSM has helped me create several fine-grained maps that shed more light on local problems in Serbia such as pollution, car accidents or violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are hoping to bring together environmental, sensory data and public attitude data on environmental issues? How can mapping help? What do you expect from this project?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than ever, we are compelled to figure out how maladies spreads locally. Without mapping the hotspots, our understanding of the consequences of, for example, viral transmission or pollution is shrouded with a lot of uncertainty. We might have no clue how environmental issues shape public attitudes in localities until we use the mapping to turn on the light. Mapping would help this project pin down geographic clusters that require immediate attention from the private and public stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/talk/reprex-open-data-day-2021/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;join us&lt;/a&gt; for a digital coffee, tea or beer on International Open Data Day - we will put never seen data on maps, and discuss how to build successful open collaborations, with little, independent contributions to build large data observatories. Make sure you check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://milosp.info/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Milos&amp;rsquo; amazing website&lt;/a&gt;, too!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-24-music-level-playing-field/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 21:23:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-24-music-level-playing-field/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our article, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/music-streaming-is-it-a-level-playing-field/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Music Streaming: Is It a Level Playing Field?&lt;/a&gt; is published in the February 2021 issue of CPI Antitrust Chronicle, which is fully devoted to competition policy issues in the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic growth of music streaming over recent years is potentially very positive. Streaming provides consumers with low cost, easy access to a wide range of music, while it provides music creators with low cost, easy access to a potentially wide audience. But many creators are unhappy about the major streaming platforms. They consider that they act in an unfair way, create an unlevel playing field and threaten long-term creativity in the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our paper describes and assesses the basis for one element of these concerns, competition between recordings on streaming platforms. We argue that fair competition is restricted by the nature of the remuneration arrangements between creators and the streaming platforms, the role of playlists, and the strong negotiating power of the major labels. It concludes that urgent consideration should be given to a user-centric payment system, as well as greater transparency of the factors underpinning playlist creation and of negotiated agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read the entire issue and the full text of our article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Competition Policy International&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.competitionpolicyinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2-Music-Streaming-Is-It-a-Level-Playing-Field-By-Daniel-Antal-Amelia-Fletcher-14-Peter-L.-Ormosi.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-22-jump/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Antal, co-founder of Reprex, was selected into 2021 Fellowship program of JUMP, the European Music Market Accelerator. Jump provides a framework for music professionals to develop innovative business models, encouraging the music sector to work on a transnational level.  The European Music Market Accelerator composed of MaMA Festival and Convention, UnConvention, MIL, Athens Music Week, Nouvelle Prague and Linecheck support him in the development of our two, interrelated projects over the next nine months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/project/music-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; is a demo version of the European Music Observatory based on open data, open source, automated research in open collaboration with music stakeholders. We hope that we can further develop our business model and find new users, and help the recovery of the festival and live music segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/project/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; is our AI system that validated third party music AI, such as Spotify&amp;rsquo;s or YouTube&amp;rsquo;s recommendation systems, and provides trustworthy, accountable, transparent alternatives for the European music industry. We hope to expand our pilot project from Slovakia to several European countries in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reprex, our start-up, is based in the Netherlands and the United States that validated its early products in the &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/&#34;&gt;Yes!Delft AI+Blockchain Lab&lt;/a&gt; in the Hague. In 2021, we decided to join the Dutch AI Coalition &amp;ndash; &lt;a href=&#34;https://nlaic.com/en/about-nl-aic/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;NL AIC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NL AIC is a public-private partnership in which the government, the business sector, educational and research institutions, as well as civil society organisations collaborate to accelerate and connect AI developments and initiatives. The ambition is to position the Netherlands at the forefront of knowledge and application of AI for prosperity and well-being. We are continually doing so with due observance of both the Dutch and European standards and values. The NL AIC functions as the catalyst for AI applications in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are particularly looking forward to participating in the Culture working group of NLAIC, but we will also take a look at the Security, Peace and Justice and the Energy and Sustainability working groups.  Reprex is committed to use and further develop AI solutions that fulfil the requirements of trustworthy AI, a human-centric, ethical, and accountable use of artificial intelligence.  We are committed to develop our data platforms, or automated data observatories, and our Listen Local system in this manner. Furthermore, we are involved in various scientific collaborations that are researching ideas on future regulation of copyright and fair competition with respect to AI algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to applying reproducible in an open collaboration with our business, scientific, policy and civil society partners, and facilitate the use of open data and open-source software.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ensuring the Visibility and Accessibility of European Creative Content on the World Market: The Need for Copyright Data Improvement in the Light of New Technologies</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-13-european-visibility/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 13 Feb 2021 18:10:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2021-02-13-european-visibility/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of music sales in the world is driven by AI-algorithm powered robots that create personalized playlists, recommendations and help programming radio music streams or festival lineups. It is critically important that an artist’s work is documented, described in a way that the algorithm can work with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our research paper – soon to be published – made for the Listen Local Initiative we found that 15% of Dutch, Estonian, Hungarian, or Slovak artists had no chance to be recommended, and they usually end up on &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-11-17-recommendation-analysis/&#34;&gt;Forgetify&lt;/a&gt;, an app that lists never-played songs of Spotify. In another project with rights management organizations, we found that about half of the rightsholders are at risk of not getting all their royalties from the platforms because of poor documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how come that distributors give streaming platforms songs that are not properly documented?  What sort of information is missing for the European repertoire’s visibility?  Reprex is exploring this problem in a practical cooperation with SOZA, the Slovak Performing and Mechanical Rights Society, and in an academic cooperation that involves leading researchers in the field. A manuscript co-authored Martin Senftleben, director of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ivir.nl/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Institute for Information Law&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam, and eminent researchers in copyright law and music economics, Reprex’s co-founder makes the case that Europe must invest public money to resolve this problem, because in the current scenario, the documentation costs of a song exceed the expected income from streaming platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the European Strategy for Data, the European Commission highlighted the EU’s ambition to acquire a leading role in the data economy. At the same time, the Commission conceded that the EU would have to increase its pools of quality data available for use and re-use. In the creative industries, this need for enhanced data quality and interoperability is particularly strong. Without data improvement, unprecedented opportunities for monetising the wide variety of EU creative and making this content available for new technologies, such as artificial intelligence training systems, will most probably be lost. The problem has a worldwide dimension. While the US have already taken steps to provide an integrated data space for music as of 1 January 2021, the EU is facing major obstacles not only in the field of music but also in other creative industry sectors. Weighing costs and benefits, there can be little doubt that new data improvement initiatives and sufficient investment in a better copyright data infrastructure should play a central role in EU copyright policy. A trade-off between data harmonisation and interoperability on the one hand, and transparency and accountability of content recommender systems on the other, could pave the way for successful new initiatives. &lt;a href=&#34;https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3785272&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Download the manuscript from SSRN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-12-17-demo-slovak-music-database/&#34;&gt;Slovak Demo Music Database&lt;/a&gt; project is a best example for this. We started systematically collect publicly available information from Slovak artists (in our write-in process) and ask them to give GDPR-protected further data (in our opt-in process) to create a comprehensive database that can help recommendation engines as well as market-targeting or educational AI apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that one of the problems of current AI algorithms that they solely or almost only work with English language documentation, putting other, particularly small language repertoires at risk of being buried below well-documented music mainly arriving from the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are looking for rightsholders and their organizations, artists,
researchers to work with us to find out how we can increase the visibility of European music.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feasibility Study On Promoting Slovak Music In Slovakia &amp; Abroad</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/publication/listen_local_2020/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/publication/listen_local_2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Download the study &lt;a href=&#34;https://zenodo.org/record/6427556/files/Listen_Local_Feasibility_Study_2020_SK.pdf?download=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in Slovak&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://zenodo.org/record/6427514/files/Listen_Local_Feasibility_Study_2020_EN.pdf?download=1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in English&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, realizing the low visibility and income-generating potential of Slovak music, the legislation introduced an amendment to the broadcasting act to regulate local content in radiostreams. The Slovak content promoting policy was well-intended but not based on any impact assessment, and it reached its goal only partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Slovak broadcasting quotas in comparison with other national quotas a very simple, and they are impossible to measure, which makes both compliance and enforcement very difficult. Radio editors do not get any help to find music that fits into the playlists and fulfil the quota obligations – in many cases, it is impossible for them to find out if a song actually meets the quota requirements. For the same reason, neither is enforcement possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another deficiency of the broadcasting quotas is that because of its fuzzy target, it is not clear whom it tries to help, and it has few friends. It is unclear how performers, composers or Slovak music producers can benefit from the system. Furthermore, it only helps a few genres, and it decreases the chances of other Slovak music in instrumental and non-Slovak language genres (for example, classical, jazz, rock) to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at last, radio is losing its importance in music discovery. New generation find the music during their music discovery age on YouTube and digital streaming platforms. A Slovak content promoting policy that does not work on digital streaming platforms will be obsolete when radio content providers will switch to digital streaming in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Feasibility Study follows the following logic:&lt;/strong&gt;
In the first chapter we introduce various music recommendation systems in the context of local content promotion polices, like local mandatory content quota regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second chapter, we consider the market-based or creative industry economy supporting policy goals, measurements, and potential support given to artists and producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then turn in the third chapter to content-based local regulations promoting the use of the Slovak language or Slovak music content, irrespective of the performers and producers nationality, residence or ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We introduce the idea of the &lt;strong&gt;Slovak Music Database&lt;/strong&gt;, a comprehensive, mainly opt-in, opt-out database that of Slovak artists and Slovak music that should be supported by the local content regulation and other policies. We also create a Demo Slovak Music Database to understand the problem and scope of the creation of the comprehensive version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project website contains the &lt;a href=&#34;https://listen-local.net/project/demo-sk-music-db/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Slovak Music Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://listen-local.net/project/demo-app/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Recommendation System&lt;/a&gt;. We explain here &lt;a href=&#34;https://listen-local.net/post/2020-11-23-alternative-recommendations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;why&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-questions&#34;&gt;Research questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are the total market shares of Slovak music relatively low both on the domestic and the foreign markets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we measure the market share of the Slovak music in the domestic and foreign markets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we measure the value gap between what some media platforms, most particularly the biggest YouTube, does not pay out to the Slovak stakeholders within Slovakia?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the interplay of the various definitions on market share and national quota targets?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How ‘shadow-markets’ of home copying and unlicensed media platforms, such as YouTube impact market shares directly and national quotas indirectly?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can modern data science, predictive microeconomics and statistics help increase the market share of Slovak music in Slovakia and abroad?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Demo Slovak Music Database</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2020-12-17-demo-slovak-music-database/</link>

      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2020-12-17-demo-slovak-music-database/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are finalizing our first local recommendation system, Listen Local Slovakia, and the accompanying Demo Slovak Music Database. Our aim is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show how the Slovak repertoire is seen by media and streaming platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the possibilities to give greater visibility to the Slovak repertoire in radio and streaming platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the specific problems why certain artists and music is almost invisible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next year, we would like to create a modern, comprehensive national music database that serves music promotion in radio, streaming, live music within Slovakia and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To train our locally relevant, &lt;a href=&#34;https://reprex.nl/post/2020-12-15-alternative-recommendations/&#34;&gt;alternative recommendation system&lt;/a&gt;, we filled the Demo Slovak Music Database from two sources. In the &lt;code&gt;opt-in&lt;/code&gt; process we asked artists to participate in Listen Local, and we selected those artists who opted in from Slovakia, or whose language is Slovak. In the &lt;code&gt;write-in&lt;/code&gt; process we collected publicly available data from other artists that our musicology team considered to be Slovak, mainly on the basis of their language use, residence, and other public biographical information. The following artists form the basis of our experiment. (&lt;em&gt;If you want to be excluded from the write-in list, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/#contact&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;write to us&lt;/a&gt;, or you want to be included, please, fill out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe seamless =&#34;&#34; name=&#34;iframe&#34; src=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/htmlwidgets/sk_artist_table.html&#34; width=&#34;1000&#34; height=&#34;1050&#34; &gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern recommendation systems usually rely on data provided by artists or their representatives, data on who and how is listening to their music, and what music is listened to by the audience of the artists, and certain musicological features of the music.  Usually they collect data from various data sources, but these data sources are mainly English language sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with these recommendation systems is that they do not help music discovery, and make starting new acts very difficult. Recommendation systems tend to help already established artists, and artists whose work is well described in the English language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our alternative recommendation system is a utility-based system that gives a user-defined priority to artists released in Slovakia, or artists identified as Slovak, or both. The system can be extended for lyrics language priorities, too.
Currently, our app is demonstration to provide a more comprehensive database-driven tool that can support various music discovery, recommendation or music export tools. Our Feasibility Study to build such tools and our Demo App is currently under consultation with Slovak stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/tag/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; is developing transparent algorithms and open source solutions to find new audiences for independent music. We want to correct the injustice and inherent bias of market leading big data algorithms. If you want&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;your music and audience&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;to be analysed in Listen Local, fill&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;in. We will include you in our demo application for local music recommendations and our analysis to be revealed in December.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommendation systems utilize knowledge about music content and their audiences while also pursuing the objectives or needs of recommenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest recommendation systems just follow the charts: for example, they select from well-known current or perennial greatest hits. Such a system may work well for an amateur DJ in a home party or a small local radio that just wants to make sure that the music in its programme will be liked by many people. They reinforce existing trends and make already popular songs and their creators even more popular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the recommendation engine is supported by big data and a machine learning system &amp;ndash; or increasingly, a combination of several machine learning algorithms &amp;ndash; the general &lt;em&gt;modus operandi&lt;/em&gt; is to exploit information about both content and users in order to achieve certain goals.&lt;/p&gt;

      How recommendation systems work?
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotify’s recommendation system is a mix of content- and collaborative filtering that exploits information about users’ past behaviour (e.g. liked, skipped, and re-listened songs), the behaviour of similar users, as well as data collected from the users&amp;rsquo; social media and other online activities, or from blogs. Deezer uses a similar system that is boosted by the acquisition of Last.fm &amp;ndash; big data created from user comments are used to understand the mood of the songs, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
      Spotify makes 16 billion music recommendations each month in 2020.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube, which plays an even larger role in music discovery, uses a system comprised of two neural networks: one for candidate generation and one for ranking. The candidate generation deep neural network provides works on the basis of collaborative filtering, while the ranking system is based on content-based filtering and a form of utility ranking that takes into consideration the user&amp;rsquo;s languages, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes these systems common is that they maximize the algorithm creators&amp;rsquo; corporate key performance indicators. Spotify wants to be ‘your playlist to life’ and increase the amount of music played during work or sports in the background, during travelling, or active music listening –- i.e. maximizing the number of hours spent using it, and do not let empty timeslots for other music providers, such as radio stations. YouTube and Netflix have similar targets. They are in many ways like commercial radio targets, which want to maximize the time spent listening to the broadcast stream. Radios and YouTube, in particular, have similar goals because they are mainly financed through advertising. For Spotify or Netflix, their key financial motivation is to avoid users&amp;rsquo; cancelling their subscriptions or changing it to different providers, such as Amzon, Apple or Deezer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-problem-with-black-box-recommendation-systems&#34;&gt;What is the problem with black box recommendation systems?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What they also have in common is that they do not aim to give a fair chance to each uploaded song, serve equally every artist, or provide whatever equality of chances for English, Slovak or Farsi language content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They tend to reinforce trends similarly to music charts, but with far bigger efficiency. As the Dutch comedian, author and journalist Arjen Lubach explains the YouTube algorithm, to keep their personal recommendations engaging all the day and all of the night, they create a comfortable universe for the user allows little distraction in. If the user wants to listen to global hit music, or stoner rock, it will never be distracted with anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;710&#34; height=&#34;410&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLoR2Spftwg?cc_load_policy=1&amp;origin=http://dataandlyrics.com&amp;cc_lang_pref=en&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zondag met Lubach on Dutch public broadcaster VPRO. Click settings sign to change the language of the captions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with such hyper-personalized media is that they leave no room for public activities.  Public broadcasters, which had a monopoly to television broadcasting in most European countries until the early 1990s, for example, were aiming to air a diversity of news, knowledge and access to local culture. Many countries on all continents have maintained &lt;code&gt;local content guidelines&lt;/code&gt; for broadcasting on public, commercial and community television and radio channels, for example, local music and films, and reliable news as a public service. Personalized media-, social media- and streaming platforms do not have such obligations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black box recommendation systems usually maximize a corporate key performance indicator, and they are not subject to usual public new service or local content regulations that traditional broadcast media is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal and the steps that the algorithm is pursuing is not know to content creators, and they do not know when will the algorithm work for their benefit or against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;transparent-and-regulated-ai&#34;&gt;Transparent and regulated AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our view, utility-based recommendation system can provide a bridge between current, corporate-owned systems that maximize a media or streaming platforms&amp;rsquo; business indicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public new service requirements or local content requirements (&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;national quotas&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;) set for commercial broadcasting are similar to utility or knowledge-based recommendation systems. A utility-based recommendation system, for example, would prefer from two candidates for a playlist the one that has a Slovak composer, or a performer from Wales, or which has Farsi lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Demo App creates recommendations on the basis of a pre-existing radio or personal streaming playlist that, by choice, contains a pre-defined ratio of music produced in Slovakia, or performed by Slovak artists. We will soon add Dutch and Hungarian choices to this demo, but naturally, we could add any city&amp;rsquo;s, regions&amp;rsquo;, province&amp;rsquo;s our countries preferences into the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Demo App and accompanying Feasibility Study in Slovakia shows how can a regulator create better broadcasting regulations, learning from the experience with AI-driven streaming platforms, and how can it apply the goals of local content requirements (such as a certain visibility for Slovak or a city-based music) and public service requirements (for example, spreading reliable information or stopping &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-10-30-racist-algorithm/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;hateful music&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;access-for-all&#34;&gt;Access for all&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not believe that the current heated discussion on the re-regulation of AI and music streaming will solve all the problems of independent artists, bands from ethnic or racial minorities, or otherwise vulnerable producers. New regulation can limit the unintended collateral damage of big data algorithms deployed by big corporations, but they will not bring down the benefits of AI to these creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the example of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/03/spotify-artists-promote-music-exchange-cut-royalty-rates-payola-algorithm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; new initiative that let&amp;rsquo;s artists, labels and publishers to promote their music in exchange for &lt;a href=&#34;https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-11-02/amplifying-artist-input-in-your-personalized-recommendations/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a cut in royalty rates&lt;/a&gt;. While felt by many artists injust and even corrupt, it is an answer to the growing need to influence how the recommendation algorithms are promoting certain music at the expense of tens of millions of sound recordings that are not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that algorithms create value for the users, and if artists are not happy to pay for corporations to influence black box algoritms, thatn they must collaborate and share data, and build large enough data pools so that they can deploy white, transparent algorithms that work for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Feasibility Study shows why it is important that creators have a &lt;code&gt;control over what data describes their music&lt;/code&gt;, their biographies and other information online, because corporate streaming platforms use this information for their algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should that with relatively little effort creators can &lt;code&gt;pool enough information&lt;/code&gt; to create alternative recommendation systems that follow a more agreeable goal, that is sensitive to local content requirements and more access to new artists, women or black performers, or which suppress hateful lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefit of an &lt;code&gt;open algorithm&lt;/code&gt; and pooled data is that artists can actively look for audiences in various age groups or in cities that are accessible for them on a performing tour after the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, we want to show that regulating black box, private algorithms and data monopolies is only a first step to damage control. Deploying white, transparent algorithms and building collaborative or open data pools can only guarantee fairness in the digital platforms, in recommendations, and generally in the use of AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/tag/listen-local/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Listen Local&lt;/a&gt; is developing transparent algorithms and open source solutions to find new audiences for independent music. We want to correct the injustice and inherent bias of market leading big data algorithms. If you want&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;your music and audience&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;to be analysed in Listen Local, fill&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ll_collector_2020&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this form&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;in. We will include you in our demo application for local music recommendations and our analysis to be revealed in December.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

On December 3, 2020 it published &lt;a href=&#34;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242509&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;a paper&lt;/a&gt; co-authored by Dr. Balazs Bodo, associate professor at the Institute for Information Law (IViR), Daniel Antal (Reprex, Demo Music Observatory), a data scientist interested in reproducible research, as an independent researcher, and Zoltan Puha, a Data Science PhD at Tilburg University, JADS. PLOS (Public Library of Science) is a nonprofit Open Access publisher, empowering researchers to accelerate progress in science and medicine by leading a transformation in research communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article utilizes the our reproducible datasets created with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://regions.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt; package, and builds on many years of expertise in empirical research on the field of music and audiovisual piracy, home copying and private copying compensation (see for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/publication/private_copying_croatia_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Private Copying in Croatia&lt;/a&gt;.)  Our aim is to provide reliable, high quality indicators for the creative industries not only on national, but provincial, state, regional and metropolitan area level, too, because these levels are often more relevant for creators, performers and policy-makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of the paper is Library Genesis (LG), the biggest piratical scholarly library on the internet, which provides copyright infringing access to more than 2.5 million scientific monographs, edited volumes, and textbooks. The paper uses advanced statistical methods to explain why researchers around the globe use copyright infringing knowledge resources. The analysis is based on a huge usage dataset from LG, as well as data from the World Bank, Eurostat, and Eurobarometer, to identify the role of macroeconomic factors, such as R&amp;amp;D and higher education spending, GDP, researcher density in scholarly copyright infringing activities.&lt;/p&gt;

      We created a global and a far more detailed European model for pirate book downloads.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main finding of the paper is that open access, even if it is radical, is not a panacea. The hypothesis of the research was that researchers in low-income regions use piratical open knowledge resources relatively more to compensate for the limitations of their legal access infrastructures. The authors found evidence to the contrary. Researchers in high income countries and European regions with access to high quality knowledge infrastructures, and high levels of funding use radical open access resources more intensively than researchers in lower income countries and regions, with less resourceful libraries. This means that while open knowledge is an important resource to close the knowledge gap between centrum and periphery, equality in access does not translate into equality in use. Structural knowledge inequalities are both present and are being reproduced in the context of open access resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is unique not just because of the data it is based on. It also sets new standards in interdisciplinary legal research by publishing the paper, the data and the software code in the same time in open access repositories, following reproducible research best practices &amp;mdash; the practices that we want to promote in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; and further data observatories to serve business, evidence-based policy and scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/a756542a-249d-11eb-9d7e-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-171307257&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Feasibility study for the establishment of a European Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; was published on 13 November.  Our private observatory, CEEMID was consulted in the creation of the Feasibility Study, and some of our recommendations found way into the consultant’s document. We created a Demo Music Observatory to provide a practical guidance on the decisions facing the European stakeholders, and to answer the questions that were left open in the Feasibility Study &amp;mdash; particularly on  &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/#data-gaps&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;data integration&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/#organization&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;institutional model&lt;/a&gt;, where a wrong choice can lead to very long delivery time, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/#quality&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;quality control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;#budget&#34;&gt;budgeting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been developing our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/project/music-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt; in the world&amp;rsquo;s 2nd ranked university-backed incubator program, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-25-yesdelft-validation/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Yes!Delft AI Validation Lab&lt;/a&gt; since &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-15-music-observatory-launch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;15 September 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Our aim is to show a better organizational model, examples of &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataandlyrics.com/post/2020-09-11-creating-automated-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;research automation&lt;/a&gt; and other data integration innovation that can reduce the budgetary needs of the European Music Observatory by 80-90% and provide far more timely, accurate, and relevant service than most data observatories in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEEMID has been creating a similar data observatory to the foreseen European Data Observatory, solely based on the contribution of about 60 European stakeholders.  As the &lt;em&gt;Feasibility Study&lt;/em&gt; suggests, we would be happy to transfer much of CEEMID’s content to the European Data Observatory, which could potentially fill up about 50-70% of the envisioned observatory.  We are building our Demo Music Observatory based on the 2000 pan-European indicators collected by CEEMID since 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

      Illusory data gap: active and music participation is available on EU level both for gender groups or four ethnic minorities – this is regularly featured in various European CAP surveys and in our national CAP surveys, too.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Feasibility Study is based on perceived data gaps between data needs of the European stakeholders and data availability. We have shown earlier this year to the European stakeholders that much of these data gaps are &lt;a href=&#34;post/2020-01-30-ceereport/#invisibility&#34;&gt;illusory&lt;/a&gt;. We would like to give about 50 indicators with full documentation, automated, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annual refreshment for free for all music industry users. We would like to challenge the stakeholders to formulate data requests to us and think together on the ways how could the European music industry build a better observatory faster and with less cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Feasibility Study concludes that a “European Music Observatory would require a very significant allocation of funds, beyond what could be currently expected from the possible budget of the future Creative Europe programme”.   While the Feasibility Study provide cost options, or any cost-benefit analysis, we are certain that this is an exaggeration.  Most European data observatories operate with an annual 20,000-200,000-euro subsidy.  We want to show with our Demo Music Observatory what can be achieved with an annual budget of 20,000 euros, 50,000 euros, 100,000 euros or 200,000 euros.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Launching Our Demo Music Observatory</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2020-09-15-music-observatory-launch/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 08:00:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2020-09-15-music-observatory-launch/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, on 15 September 2020, we officially launched our &lt;code&gt;minimal viable product&lt;/code&gt; as we promised to partners back in February. This was a particularly difficult period for everybody. We aspired to deliver by September in a very different environment, our hopes for commissioned work went up in flames with the pandemic, and our targeted users, musicians and music entrepreneurs, talent managers, music venues lost most of their income. The organizations helping them, granting authorities, export offices and collective management societies are overwhelmed with the problem. During these troublesome times, our team expanded, attracted great new talent, and kept working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first product is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Demo Music Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, a collaborative, automated research-based &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/faq/observatories/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;observatory&lt;/a&gt; for the music industry, one that is particularly hard hit by the COVID19 crisis. Not only great artists, composers, technicians, managers fell victim to the virus, but musicians lost about 50–90% of their income from live music. This translates to a 100% loss for the live music technicians and managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

See our &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-09-11-creating-automated-observatory/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;earlier blogpost&lt;/a&gt; on what you see on the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music industry was never a place for great job security. For putting up a show, you usually need a network of 10–200 artists, technicians and managers to work together as freelancers without all those social benefits that many people enjoy in other walks of life. We have been trying to figure out how to help this microenterprise and freelancer-network based industry with research for five years. Our aim is to make them competitive when they are talking with their buyers: Google, Apple, Spotify, who are really heavy-weight data and AI pros. Our better plan their tours, when they will be back on the road, to understand what sort of audiences and purchasing power waits for them in different European cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are launching at a time when the music industry is crying for help.Therefore, we have decided to make our demo observatory open and unfinished. Over the last 7 years, we have built up about 2000 music and creative sector indicators to be used for business KPIs, forecasting targets, grant evaluations, royalty valuations, concert demography target group analysis and other professional uses. We would like to open up, based on your needs, about 50 well-designed indicators, and pledge to keep it daily refreshed, corrected, documented, citaable, downloadable. Also, feel free to use our most valuable source code—use it for your own purposes, even modify it, as long as you keep it open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our smaller partners, we follow what musicians do these days on Bandcamp: name your price. We make a pledge to our small partners: if you need reliable data to plan your next grant calls, calculate royalties, compensations, predict hit candidates, give us the job—and name your price. Post-corona, you can take for a dollar the best music from Bandcamp. You can take our research products, for a limited period, for any amount you name, as long as  it is for a good cause and serves the industry, musicians, technicians or managers. In return, we ask for your feedback. Help us validate whether we are on the right track, tell us how we can cooperate after the pandemic, in better times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our larger and better funded partners? We ask you to pay the price we name, because we believe that it is a well-justified, fair and competitive price, set by pricing experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We appreciate it if you take a look at our offering, or if you pass this blogpost on to your colleagues in the industry.  Our main target audience initially are music professional in broader Europe, but we are planning to cover all major global markets very soon, too. Feedback from the U.S., Australia, Canada, Colombia, Brazil &amp;amp; Argentina is particularly welcome as we have great plans over there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-we-are&#34;&gt;Who we are?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-08-24-start-up/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; our operations on 1 September 2020 on the basis of &lt;a href=&#34;http://documentation.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CEEMID&lt;/a&gt;, a pan-European data observatory that created about 2000 music and creative industry indicators for its users. In the coming days, we are gradually opening up about 50 &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;music industry&lt;/a&gt; and 50 broader creative industry indicators in a fully reproducible workflow, with daily re-freshed, re-processed, well-formatted and documented indicators for business and policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to validate this approach in one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most prestigious university-backed incubator programs, in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yesdelft.com/yes-programs/ai-blockchain-validation-lab/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Yes!Delft AI/Blockchain Validation Lab&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re finalist on their selection, and all help before 23 September from our friends in the music industry is more than appreciated. If we get there, we can rely on probably the best pros in Europe to make our offering better tailored and financially sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;get-in-touch&#34;&gt;Get in touch!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use the very simple and extremely secure &lt;strong&gt;keybase.io&lt;/strong&gt;, a kind of mix of Whatsapp, Skype, Google Drive, One Drive and zoom. You can get in touch on that platform with us in anytime &lt;a href=&#34;https://keybase.io/team/reprexcommunity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating An Automated Data Observatory</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/post/2020-09-11-creating-automated-observatory/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2020 16:00:39 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/post/2020-09-11-creating-automated-observatory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are building data ecosystems, so called observatories, where scientific, business, policy and civic users can find factual information, data, evidence for their domain.  Our open source, open data, open collaboration approach allows to connect various open and proprietary data sources, and our reproducible research workflows allow us to automate data collection, processing, publication, documentation and presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our scripts are checking data sources, such as Eurostat&amp;rsquo;s Eurobase, Spotify&amp;rsquo;s API and other music industry sources every day for new information, and process any data corrections or new disclosure, interpolate, backcast or forecast missing values, make currency translations and unit conversions. This is shown illustrated with an &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-07-25-reproducible_ingestion/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;earlier post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fQJHflWPS34&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For direct access to the file visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/video/making-of-dmo.mp4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the video we show automated the creation of an observatory website with well-formatted, statistical data dissemination, a technical document in PDF and an ebook can be automated.  In our view, our technology is particularly useful technology in business and scientific researech projects, where it is important that always the most timely and correct data is being analyzed, and remains automatically documented and cited. We are ready deploy public, collaborative, or private data observatories in short time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data processing costs can be as high as 80% for any in-house AI deployment project. We work mainly with organization that do not have in house data science team, and acquire their data anyway from outside the organization. In their case, this rate can be as high as 95%, meaning that getting and processing the data for deploying AI can be 20x more expensive than the AI solution itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI solutions require a large amount of standardized, well processed data to learn from.  We want to radically decrease the cost of data acquisition and processing for our users so that exploiting AI becomes in their reach. This is particularly important in one of our target industries, the music industries, where most of the global sales is algorithmic and AI-driven. Artists, bands, small labels, publishers, even small country national associations cannot remain competitive if they cannot participate in this technological revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataobservatory.eu/post/2020-08-24-start-up/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;started&lt;/a&gt; our operations on 1 September 2020 on the basis of &lt;a href=&#34;http://documentation.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CEEMID&lt;/a&gt;, a pan-European data observatory that created about 2000 music and creative industry indicators for its users. In the coming days, we are gradually opening up about 50 &lt;a href=&#34;https://music.dataobservatory.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;music industry&lt;/a&gt; and 50 broader creative industry indicators in a fully reproducible workflow, with daily re-freshed, re-processed, well-formatted and documented indicators for business and policy decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to validate this approach in one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most prestigious university-backed incubator programs, in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yesdelft.com/yes-programs/ai-blockchain-validation-lab/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Yes!Delft AI/Blockchain Validation Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>retroharmonize R package for survey harmonization</title>
      <link>https://reprex.nl/software/retroharmonize/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://reprex.nl/software/retroharmonize/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;retrospective-data-harmonization&#34;&gt;Retrospective data harmonization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of &lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; is to provide tools for reproducible
retrospective (ex-post) harmonization of datasets that contain variables
measuring the same concepts but coded in different ways. Ex-post data
harmonization enables better use of existing data and creates new
research opportunities. For example, harmonizing data from different
countries enables cross-national comparisons, while merging data from
different time points makes it possible to track changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retrospective data harmonization is associated with challenges including
conceptual issues with establishing equivalence and comparability,
practical complications of having to standardize the naming and coding
of variables, technical difficulties with merging data stored in
different formats, and the need to document a large number of data
transformations. The &lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; package assists with the latter
three components, freeing up the capacity of researchers to focus on the
first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the &lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; package proposes a reproducible
workflow, including a new class for storing data together with the
harmonized and original metadata, as well as functions for importing
data from different formats, harmonizing data and metadata, documenting
the harmonization process, and converting between data types. See
&lt;a href=&#34;https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/reference/retrohamonize.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
for an overview of the functionalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;code&gt;labelled_spss_survey()&lt;/code&gt; class is an extension of &lt;a href=&#34;https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/labelled_spss.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;haven’s labelled_spss class&lt;/a&gt;. It not
only preserves variable and value labels and the user-defined missing
range, but also gives an identifier, for example, the filename or the
wave number, to the vector. Additionally, it enables the preservation –
as metadata attributes – of the original variable names, labels, and
value codes and labels, from the source data, in addition to the
harmonized variable names, labels, and value codes and labels. This way,
the harmonized data also contain the pre-harmonization record. The
stored original metadata can be used for validation and documentation
purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vignette &lt;a href=&#34;https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/labelled_spss_survey.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Working With The labelled_spss_survey Class&lt;/a&gt;
provides more information about the &lt;code&gt;labelled_spss_survey()&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/harmonize_labels.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Harmonize Value Labels&lt;/a&gt;
we discuss the characteristics of the &lt;code&gt;labelled_spss_survey()&lt;/code&gt; class and
demonstrates the problems that using this class solves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also provide three extensive case studies illustrating how the
&lt;code&gt;retroharmonize&lt;/code&gt; package can be used for ex-post harmonization of data

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CEEMID &amp;amp; Consolidated Independent presented and discussed with stakeholders the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/ceereport_2020/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Central &amp;amp; Eastern European Music Industry Report 2020&lt;/a&gt; as a case-study on national and comparative evidence-based policymaking in the cultural and creative sector on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://creativeflip.creativehubs.net/2019/12/03/flipping-the-odds/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;CCS Ecosystems: FLIPPING THE ODDS Conference&lt;/a&gt; – a two-day high-level stakeholder event jointly organized by Geothe-Institute and the DG Education and Culture of the European Commission with the Creative FLIP project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEE Report builds on the results of the first &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/hungary_music_industry_2014/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Slovak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/private_copying_croatia_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Croatian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://czdev.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Czech&lt;/a&gt; music industry reports are compared with Armenian, Austrian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian, Serbian and Slovenian data and findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research findings were earlier presented and discussed in Vienna, Prague, Budapest and Bratislava with stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the earlier presentations in the &lt;a href=&#34;#posts&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; section of the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;executive-summary&#34;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first Central European Music Industry Report is the result of a co-operation that started among stakeholders in three EU countries five years ago to measure the economic value added of music – the basis of a modern royalty pricing system. This gave birth to CEEMID, originally the Central &amp;amp; Eastern European Music Industry Databases, a data integration programme that now in 2020, covers all of Europe. CEEMID fulfils similar roles to the planned European Music Observatory and supports all pillars of the future pan-European system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The comparison of Western and Eastern music audiences reveals key demographic differences that make the unchanged adoption of business practices from mature markets in the region questionable. &lt;a href=&#34;http://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/audience.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt; of this report will show these differences and their consequences on music markets, in terms of visiting and acquisition likelihood, frequency, seasonality and purchasing capacity. This is an example of how CEEMID fulfils the role of Pillar 3 (music, society and citizenship) in the planned European Music Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/supply.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chapter 3&lt;/a&gt; contrasts market demand with the supply strategies of musicians. CEEMID has been surveying music professionals, including artists, technicians and managers about their working conditions, market conditions and plans for five years across a growing number of countries. In 2019 we invited 100 national and regional stakeholders to distribute our surveys. In some countries, our surveys already have several years of historic data, making the resulting musician database probably the largest ever source of data about how music is produced and how musicians live. We are constantly looking for partners to roll out this survey to new countries in new languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEE region has comparative advantages in big music events like festivals, and it has become one of the most important hubs for cultural tourism in the world. We explain this phenomenon in Chapter 4 by showing the differences in demand composition, demography and supply of venues in the second chapter. The lack of a modern and dense network of permanent music venues gave rise to magnificent music festivals in the CEE. Open’er, Sziget and Exit are among the biggest and best festivals in the world, closely followed by several smaller festivals in all countries. The share of festivals in the live music market is many times higher than in Western Europe and they provide vital export revenues to the local music economies. However, they play a limited role in finding new audiences for local artists, as they are increasingly programming for Western audiences by providing shows of international hits. They can only very partially fill in the gaps left by the small venue problem that hit the emerging markets harder than the UK or Australia, where policy action had been already taken to reverse the decline of the availability of smaller live music venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the recording side, our analysis shows that modern digital services are growing at a faster rate than in mature markets. Because of lower repertoire competition, streaming quantities are similar for a typical Austrian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish or Slovak track than in the mature markets. However, revenue growth is limited because of the interplay of several analysed factors. Our analysis of the live and recorded music markets shows that CEEMID fulfils the roles of the Pillar 1 (music economy) of the planned European Music Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recorded music sales revenue in the region comes from streaming platforms, just like in the mature markets. Successful sales strategies require a solid knowledge of the global marketplace and the ability to understand and train sales algorithms. Micro-enterprises, such as independent labels, have very limited ability to cope with these functions, given that they do not have market research or R&amp;amp;D functions. CEEMID and Consolidated Independent have started initiating open, national R&amp;amp;D consortia to create the necessary concentration in data assets, analytical capacity and budgets to close this gap. As a first step, CEEMID and Consolidated Independent have created a large, independent music dataset based on hundreds of millions of royalty statement entries to create our market indexes, styled after stock market and bond market indexes. Streaming opportunities are fast changing as roll-out of streaming services is happening at a different rate in various territories; subscription charges and the exchange rate to the producer’s currency vary and repertoire competition emerges in the market. Our volume and revenue indexes in &lt;a href=&#34;http://ceereport2020.ceemid.eu/export.html#recexport&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Chapter 5.3&lt;/a&gt; are aimed at creating sales algorithms that optimize sales volumes and expected revenues. We believe that this analysis also reveals that CEEMID partially fulfils the roles of Pillar 2 (music diversity and circulation) and feeds important data into Pillar 4 (innovation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The region has far bigger untapped potential than most music business executives believe. Households in the region spend a significantly lower share of their recreational budget on music than their Western, Southern or Nordic peers. The region has a lot of untapped cultural purchasing power because servicing is particularly challenging in both the live and recorded sides of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This upside potential cannot be tapped without better pricing. Royalty levels are often very low in the region. Due to many combined effects analysed in this short report, the gap between royalties earned in the CEE and Western Europe is several times bigger than the difference in GDP or national average wage. These gaps are partly caused by special interests preventing collective management from charging appropriate tariffs for restaurants, media companies or electronic appliance importers and manufacturers, and partly by unfavourable taxation of cultural products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEEMID was designed to create economic evidence on royalty pricing, private copying compensation and the creation of economic value added in the industry. In the first Hungarian Music Industry Report of ProArt and in the first Slovak Music Industry Report we have shown that economic and taxation policies of the CEE countries aimed to support car and electronics manufacturing create a distorted, unfavourable economic regime for creative industries. We want to help local stakeholders with economic evidence to correct these discriminatory policies during the overhaul of the EU VAT system. We have been helping various national organizations with economic evidence, presented in the light of latest EU jurisprudence, to improve their pricing activities. Our thousands of indicators were also used in ex ante evaluations of granting schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020, all EU member states will change their copyright administration legislation because of the national implementations of the 2019/790 Digital Single Market directive. CEEMID provides evidence in several countries about the size and impact mechanism of the value transfer, and generally the widespread use of the copyright exemption for private copying. We believe that the thousands of pan-European music industry indicators that we have aggregated over the five years will play a vital role in these regulatory processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEEMID fulfils its roles with a very thorough exploitation of the EU’s 17-years-old Open Data regime with the re-use of public sector information, and a very careful mapping of the music industry. These maps help us conduct annual surveys among musicians and the audience, and they help us connect (always with pre-approval and with a user mandate) to industry databases. We do not only cover the EU countries, but increasingly (potential) candidate countries and neighbourhood countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our vision, this data collection and integration, i.e. Pillars 1-3 should be available for all music stakeholders, should remain public and publicly funded. The last Pillar of the observatory, innovation, is where private entities should compete. The founders of CEEMID and Consolidated Independent believe that this report demonstrates the business and policy benefits of such a system with the analysis of the Central &amp;amp; Eastern European music markets. We believe that this way CEEMID is in a position to serve most of the planned functions of the envisioned European Music Observatory, and we are looking for ways to make either our thousands of indicators, or our data collection and integration software open source and available for all stakeholders in the EU and its neighbours. CEEMID was born out of necessity to level out the different levels of public research and statistical coverage of the EU member states. In our view, private entities in the future should focus their investments in Pillar 4 of the planned observatory, i.e. competing in innovation with creating new models, algorithms and services based on data that is available throughout the European Union without giving further advantage to the already mature markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with sub-national statistics has many benefits. In policymaking or in social sciences, it is a common practice to compare national statistics, which can be hugely misleading. The United States of America, the Federal Republic of Germany, Slovakia and Luxembourg are all countries, but they differ vastly in size and social homogeneity. Comparing Slovakia and Luxembourg to the federal states or even regions within Germany, or the states of Germany and the United States can provide more adequate insights. Statistically, the similarity of the aggregation level and high number of observations can allow more precise control of model parameters and errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages of switching from a national level of the analysis to a
sub-national level comes with a huge price in data processing,
validation and imputation. The package Regions aims to help this
process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This package is an offspring of the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;eurostat&lt;/a&gt; package on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://ropengov.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;rOpenGov&lt;/a&gt;. It started as a tool to validate and re-code regional Eurostat statistics, but it aims to be a general solution for all sub-national statistics. It will be developed parallel with other rOpenGov packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequent boundary changes&lt;/strong&gt;: as opposed to national boundaries,
the territorial units, typologies are often change, and this makes
the validation and recoding of observation necessary across time.
For example, in the European Union, sub-national typologies change
about every three years and you have to make sure that you compare
the right French region in time, or, if you can make the time-wise
comparison at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchical aggregation and special imputation&lt;/strong&gt;: missingness is
very frequent in sub-national statistics, because they are created
with a serious time-lag compared to national ones, and because they
are often not back-casted after boundary changes. You cannot use
standard imputation algorithms because the observations are not
similarly aggregated or averaged. Often, the information is
seemingly missing, and it is present with an obsolete typology code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;package-functionality&#34;&gt;Package functionality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generic vocabulary translation and joining functions for
geographically coded data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping track of the boundary changes within the European Union
between 1999-2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vocabulary translation and joining functions for standardized
European Union statistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vocabulary translation for the &lt;code&gt;ISO-3166-2&lt;/code&gt; based Google data and
the European Union&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imputation functions from higher aggregation hierarchy levels to
lower ones, for example from &lt;code&gt;NUTS1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;NUTS2&lt;/code&gt; or from &lt;code&gt;ISO-3166-1&lt;/code&gt;
to &lt;code&gt;ISO-3166-2&lt;/code&gt; (impute down)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imputation functions from lower hierarchy levels to higher ones
(impute up)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregation function from lower hierarchy levels to higher ones, for
example from NUTS3 to &lt;code&gt;NUTS1&lt;/code&gt; or from &lt;code&gt;ISO-3166-2&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ISO-3166-1&lt;/code&gt;
(aggregate; under development)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disaggregation functions from higher hierarchy levels to lower ones,
again, for example from &lt;code&gt;NUTS1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;NUTS2&lt;/code&gt; or from &lt;code&gt;ISO-3166-1&lt;/code&gt; to
&lt;code&gt;ISO-3166-2&lt;/code&gt; (disaggregate; under development)&lt;/li&gt;
